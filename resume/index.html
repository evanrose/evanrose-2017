<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>As a designer turned developer and programmer with over fifteen years of experience working on the web, I've gotten the chance to work with everything from server administration to designing mockups in Photoshop, but my core competency is developing dynamic websites and web applications on the LAMP stack with an emphasis on WordPress theme and plugin development and producing clean and maintainable HTML, CSS/Sass, and JavaScript. In addition to development, I am happy working on many platforms, operating systems, version control systems, content management systems, programming languages, and anything else that happens between the file system and the user's browser. I am also glad to interface with internal or external clients and leading or being part of a talented group that is devoted to doing great work.</p>
