<p>after a whole wonderful weekend (walking the haight, cooking dinner, renting a movie, 
lazing until the next evening) with one, i had a whole wonderful week with the other 
and i wish i knew what it was about being in another country and doing different 
things yet being so very comfortable ("i'm more myself when i'm with you") that 
makes me feel so apart of and ok - and it was wonderful getting picked up by luc 
and and going to class and hanging out at the student bar and sheep and her wonderful 
apartment and the balcony and hanging at cafe folies (the cooliest coffee shop ever) 
below and jessica and shawn's place and eating tofu meat and vegetarian lasanga with 
pumpkin pie and the awesome thanksgiving dinner party and the walk to find more 
pumpkin pie and a blender before hand and more walking and more shopping and speaking 
horrible french and seeing sleepers and bounce and 
<a href="http://www.requiemforadream.com" target="_top">requiem for a dream</a>  
(<a href="001109.html">again</a>) and the 
jai bar and 
<a href="http://www.pollyesthers.com/montreal/" target="_top">polly esther's</a> 
and the bookstore at the 
<a href="http://www.cca.qc.ca/contents.html" target="_top">canadian center for architecture</a> 
and drinking lots of coffee and smoking lots of cigarettes 
and though i came home 
feeling the same way i did 
last year, i was much more peaceful as i was unconcerned about the plane crashing and 
looking forward to tending to the life i have here that's still so new and exciting but  
remembering excellent conversation where i was reminded of things that i was glad i 
had forgotten and the concequences of unconditional love (and the disappointment 
in myself and the situation that followed) yet looking forward 
to a long and expensive dinner and doing it all again in the very near future</p>
