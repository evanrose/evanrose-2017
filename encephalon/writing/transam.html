i'm trying to convince todd to go to the transam show in may by making a tape, but my mind is on the 
future, as it were, or i guess, as it will be, perhaps.  got a lot of big things coming 
up- bike's coming out of the shop, gonna road trip all over the place, then expatriate to europe 
to avoid the fucking y2k bug.  i guess that when that's all said and done, my life, as i know 
it will be over.  i'll come home, work, finish school, maybe marry, retire, then die, only to have my 
mark quickly blown away by the winds of time.  really and truly, i should end it now- 
it'd be better than unanswered questions.  it'd be better than deathbed regrets.  it'd be better 
than being forgotten after such effort, but i digress.  i've got too much to do.  i've gotta 
write a book, gotta have a gallery show, gotta make a record, gotta have my own company, 
i've gotta fall in love at least one more time.  man, what the fuck am i thinking?  i can't kill 
myself tonight, or tomorrow, or next week.  i can't kill myself until at least the middle of may, 
'cause transam is coming.  and by then, i'll be ready to start my journey.  fuck it.  
i guess i'll just finish todd's tape and think it all over tomorrow, or maybe 
just finish this side 'cause i'm about ready for bed.
