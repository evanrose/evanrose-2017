Serial 2 : Gear for the Ear 
<br>

 By dj encephalon 
<br>
 Every time I go to buy needles or wires at the music store, some
 kid always asks me "hey, are you a dj?" When I say yes, they ask
 for advice. I'm happy to give it though, because advice that I didn't
 get when I started spinning might have saved me a lot of time,
 energy, and money. I started spinning on two Gemini turntables
 and a low end Gemini mixer; great products, don't get me wrong,
 but I believe that dealing with their problems held me back. Gemini
 turntables are notorious for being extremely sensitive to shocks and
 tweaking, even just tapping the platter to slow down a record can
 wreck a mix. When the mix is critical, that just won't do. The mixer
 was the cheapest I could find, but I learned quickly that I get
 exactly what I pay for. The most limiting aspect of this mixer was
 the bass control; I could have the bass on, or I could turn it off. My
 earliest mix-tapes tell a tale of either too much treble, or basslines
 fighting to be heard the whole way through. I let these kids know
 that they'll be much better off paying more for high quality gear later
 than buying the not-so-good gear they can afford now, The time it
 takes learning how to make low end gear work for you is time that
 can be spent practicing skills and getting gigs. For me, it's a much
 better feeling knowing that mistakes that get made are my own
 fault, and not the fault of the gear I'm using. I recommend Technics
 1200mk2 turntables. Not only are they workhorses that will last
 forever, but they're the industry standard. Vestax turntables may be
 even better, as far as torque (starting speed) and stability go, but I
 find them to be a bit pricey. Unlike turntables, mixers are a bit
 difficult to rate. All of the big guys, Vestax, Gemini, and Numark
 are really good, but the best mixer is one that has the options you
 need. A new dj's best bet would be to talk to other djs and find out
 what they like about their mixers, think about what features they'll
 need, then get the mixer that has those features, again regardless
 of the price. I use a Gemini Platinum Series P-626 that has treated
 me real well the entire time I've had it. It has three channels for the
 times that I want to hook up a third turntable and spin with a friend,
 separate bass, mid, and high controls for each channel, and a
 visual equalizer for each channel to tell when I'm getting to loud for
 my system. A good mixer will also have kill switches for each
 channel, and separate booth (monitor), master balance, and master
 volume controls. Keep in mind though, a dj can't spin with just
 tables and a mixer. He's got to have a monitor (a set of speakers
 that play what the house is hearing, only closer) and an amp to run
 the speakers. He's got to have good wires to connect everything
 together, and he's got to have needles and cartridges that are
 durable enough to handle the stress of being pushed and pulled, on
 and off the record all night. I don't know if these kids take my advice
 or not. I know I had to have a set of tables right then, and didn't wait
 to get the gear that I knew would be much better, and that's
 sometimes the case even to this day. I'm still learning, but I know
 now, that I can learn much better and faster if the quality of my gear
 doesn't hold me back.
