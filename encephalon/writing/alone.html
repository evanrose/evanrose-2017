alone and lonely, i guess the way <br>

i want it to be<br>
how am i supposed to meet her when<br>
she won't even look at me<br>
the musics right, the time is right<br>
why'd i roll solo?<br>
these "happy" couples, what do they do<br>
that i don't do?<br>
waited and waited for phone calls<br>
does no one need anyone else<br>
to have and to hold to be seen<br>
and heard and felt<br>
they probably think i don't need anyone<br>
i act as if that's the case<br>
never can let them know i'm dying<br>
inside me terrible waste<br>
tonight its not so bad i don't find<br>
that i need her now<br>
its just the waiting all of the time<br>
and the time goes by so slow<br>
she kept looking my way did i look good<br>
what in the world should...<br>
should i say or do or not doing<br>
it would do any good<br>
i let her look, made me feel ok<br>
for a second or two<br>
i felt atractive i felt whole but<br>
this situation's not new<br>
just two eyes passing on, crossing<br>
nope, only passing through
