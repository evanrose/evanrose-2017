i was walking out the door to get the laundry when the phone rang.  it was lara.  i don't know 
if its me or her, but i just don't have a thing to say to that girl.  when we met, she came up
and gave me her number in a coffee shop in fort worth-  i thought she was cute, waited to days
(protocol) and called her.  i talked, she laughed, we met up.  she said she liked to slow dance, she 
was too young to know better.  she was wearing a wedding band.  "its an abstinence ring" she said.
"abstinence from what?"  it was done before it got off the ground.  she still calls
though, about once every three days, and i haven't a goddamned thing to say.  it almost seems as 
though we've known and loved, but those have passed- but we met only two months ago!  i actually
had time to talk, and told her exactly how little i had to say.  she replied in kind.  i had to
get to work though, saying my goodbyes, not waiting for or caring about hers.  lit up a smoke
and headed to the laundry and i'll be damned if it wasn't still wet.  those dryers never work.
