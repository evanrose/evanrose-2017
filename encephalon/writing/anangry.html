an angry, fierce fear<br>
i carry it through my days<br>
dragging it like a ball and chain<br>
holding me at gunpoint<br>
suddenly, for a moment<br>
i'm free!  i'm free<br>
but it comes back with its friends<br>
oh what sweet relief<br>
i thought i'd forgotten something<br>
this little brain is so busy<br>
it gets so tired<br>
tired of all the bullshit<br>
it wants to go to sleep sometimes<br>
and never wake up<br>
it likes its handcuffs,<br>
its imprisonment.<br>
just a slave to my feelings<br>
but i don't know what they are<br>
seems i'm in a cell<br>
and they're poking me with sharp sticks<br>
but i'm blind and deaf<br>
my head feels so nice<br>
cool and protected<br>
here in the sand
