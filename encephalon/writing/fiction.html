i sit at my desk looking out of the open window.  something is telling me to jump but i know that 
would leave lots of unanswered questions, mostly for myself.  i take another drag from my cigarette, then put 
it out in an overflowing ashtray.  i turn to sniff another rail, but instead, pick up my 
coffee cup and go over to the wall safe that is already open.  i grab my gun, a polished
 walther ppk, cock it and put it to my head.  then i drop it, cursing.  i can't be defeated.  i must
face it.  i must.  i sit back at the desk, staring at the picture of sheila.  i close my eyes and snort 
the line.  that will keep me up for another hour or so.  i've been awake, waiting, for how many days?  
one more hour might make the difference.  i again face the window, sipping my coffee.<br>
i wake with a start an hour later hearing footsteps approaching my office.  i turn and face out the 
open door, and i feel my bladder let go.  i see a shadow on the wall of some grotesque mutant, shuffling 
along.  it is short, stout, with a beaklike face, and batlike wings.  i'm reminded briefly of demons 
in the books at saint peter's catholic school i attended as a boy.  i am paralyzed with fright 
thinking that the dts were too intense this time.  then she steps into my office, and i utter a small gasp.<br>
she is beautiful.  a veritable goddess with hair black as night and red eyes as hot as fire.  she is 
wearing a long black dress, and her lipstick looks as though it could have been the blood of an infant.  
i could still see the shadow behind her.<br>
she walked over to me, and i noticed the way she walked; seductively, catlike.  she had a beautiful body 
and was shedding her clothing as she walked toward me.  she was finaly naked when she reached my desk 
and she climbed over it to get to me.  i backed against the window wondering what the hell was going on.  
i knew i was being sought after, but by this?  she grabbed my tie and gave me a kiss so deep and
 sensuous i had an orgasm.  she sucked on my tounge and i felt a change in my body, an ache in my back 
like i was breaking through my own skin.  i felt my tounge go further into her mouth, and soon, it was 
down her throught.  i realized i was naked, and i pushed her onto my desk and entered her.<br>
that's all i can remember, here as i sit on my desk, on my haunches, my claws digging into the mahogany.  
my office is destroyed, but it doesn't matter, my life as a business man is over.  i take one more look 
at sheila, then i step off my desk, unfurling my wings.  i step out of the 34th floor window and take 
off into the night.
