a letter from the other boy<BR>
you won't let me read it<BR>
what are you trying to hide?<BR>
and why?<BR>
its here in my hand<BR>
but i told you i wouldn't<BR>
what would i find out<BR>
i can't trust you<BR>
but i'm the liar<BR>v
and my stomach is burning<BR>
night and day<BR>
wondering<BR>
who the fucked up one is.<BR>
i'm a better man than him?<BR>
secrets between us<BR>
will kill the void<BR>
i want to know so badly<BR>
but i promised<BR>
and i hate you for it<BR>
but i'll love you tonight<BR>
when you come get in bed<BR>
with me<BR>
i'll know everything's all right.<BR>
but what about<BR>
the letter you wrote back?<BR>
