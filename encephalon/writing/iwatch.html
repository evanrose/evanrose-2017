i watch her standing<br>
silouetted by the rising sun<br>
next to a window facing east<br>
she stands there naked<br>
turning her head to face me<br>
hand on her curving hip<br>
a lock of hair falling<br>
i see her mischevous look<br>
and i smile<br>
she comes to me<br>
and i accept her<br>
taking her in my arms<br>
loving her<br>
thinking of dinner, laughter, music<br>
thinking of dancing, drinking<br>
walking hand in hand<br>
she takes me<br>
she moves me<br>
she loves me more than i can take<br>
like rivers flowing to the sea<br>
i flow into her<br>
parting her filling her<br>
giving myself to her<br>
becoming one with her<br>
knowing i'll never be the same
