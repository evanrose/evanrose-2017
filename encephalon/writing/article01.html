Serial 1: Get ready, Get Set…
<br>
 By: dj encephalon
<br>
 So you wanna to be a dj? I know the feeling. Watching djs for
 years, collecting records, buying mix-tapes and raving back in the
 day. I should have known I’d eventually find myself behind some
 turntables wondering what to do with them. 
<br>
 That first time, over at a dj friend’s place, I played those two records
 over and over trying to match a beat, using only the pitch control.
 After a few hours I had a splitting headache (listening to a different
 set of beats in each ear) and had only managed to pull off one mix,
 but man, that one mix felt good. 
<br>
 I got a crew together and got us a gig down at a local hotspot. I
 was out every night, but only as an observer. I tried to pay attention
 to everything they did, like squeezing the center post to slow the
 record down, speeding it up by giving it a quick turn with a finger,
 minutely adjusting the pitch control, manipulating the bass and
 treble controls on the mixer and keeping one eye on the crowd the
 whole time.
<br>
 One night, no one could make it out, and I became the evening’s
 entertainment. I had my record bag, and by the next week I’d taken
 over the 9-11 slot. I played records out of my collection, some
 downtempo, some breakbeat, some jazz, but it was months before
 I ever matched a beat, and even longer before I could keep them
 matched. I eventually took over that gig, and then got another, and
 then another. I was out spinning almost every night, but I had, and
 still have a lot of work to do.
<br>
 Now I’ve got a weekly gig at a cool late-night restaurant, and its
 great. It pays well, I play what I want, I can experiment freely, and
 best of all, and there's no dance floor that comes to a screeching
 halt if I mess up (which happens on occasion)!
<br>
 This column will be here every week to answer your questions, offer
 advice and share mine and others’ experiences being a dj. I hope
 you enjoy it, and if you have any questions, comments or
 corrections, mail me at encephalon@edanz.com.
