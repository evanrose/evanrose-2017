oh, i am obsessed, obsessive-<br>
i want her to know my all<br>
she floats by - aware, i believe<br>
now - ever - i will not know<br>
now is not to be the time<br>
(so i have told myself)<br>
why?  i don't know.<br>
lies, untruths, plans, desires<br>
cloud my brain, my judgement<br>
my reason my meaning, my being<br>
by saying it makes no difference<br>
so often to myself<br>
it no longer makes a difference<br>
the words, these pages<br>
these desires, i, me, her...<br>
don't matter at all<br>
freedom should be found in this<br>
i make my own meaning<br>
i am forcing myself to be<br>
(but am doing nothing about it)<br>
waiting, for what?  for it<br>
to come to me<br>
on a fucking silver platter<br>
there is nothing to fear<br>
nothing to lose<br>
nothing matters but... but...<br>
i am still afraid.  i am still<br>
afraid.  i am afraid.<br>
i am<br>
afraid.
