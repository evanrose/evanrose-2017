sitting in a booth early in the morning<br>
waiting for the coffee mable is pouring<br>
my table is still sticky and wet<br>
at 4 am its about all i expect<br>
i browse through the menu and light up a smoke<br>
the rain is beating down and i'm soaked<br>
theres someone sleeping in the booth over there<br>
and an old lady is pulling out her hair<br>
a guy is giving directions on the telephone<br>
the sleeping guy just coughed and moaned<br>
i tell her my order then i'm watchin' the news<br>
famine, disease, debt, the blues<br>
i rub my eyes, looking into the night<br>
put out my smoke and reach for my light<br>
my breakfast comes, greasy and hot<br>
my stomach is rumbling like a shot<br>
staring out the window i wonder where i am<br>
my aggs are too slimy, my bacon like spam<br>
she pours me more coffee, i reach for my gun<br>
she drops the pot, now we're having fun<br>
the first shot takes off the top of her head<br>
the phone man explodes in a spray of red<br>
the sleeping man opens his eyes<br>
just in time to see the old lady die<br>
he starts to get up, but lays back down<br>
his blood is beginning to pool all around<br>
i walk to the kitchen and pop the chef<br>
i can't hear his screams, i'm almost deaf<br>
i smile as i think of them calling me insane<br>
i finish my coffee and walk out into the rain
