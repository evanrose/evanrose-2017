           Serial 3: "The Formula" 
<br>
by dj encephalon
<br>
           Mixing Record is a very mathmatical operation because of what I call "The Formula", and in my
           experience, awareness of "The Formula" is what sets apart a good DJ from a not so good one. Let me
           explain. The formula I'm talking about breaks the beginning of your standard 12" single into 16 beat
           sections until the song "officially" starts, and once the song starts, it employs the 32 or 64 beat
           structure. The main and most difficult part of "The Formula" is the 8 or 16 beat introduction i find at the
           start of almost every song in my record bag. Many DJs, myself included, are guilty of beginning a new
           record on the beginning of a 16 measure (64 beat) progression, which eventually destroys the groove.
           Can you hear it? a build up, a drum roll, a cymbal crash... and another 16 beats later? Not good. This
           little addition to the beginnings of electronic songs, whether they be house, funky breaks, hip-hop or
           jungle, actually do serve a purpose. Many times the track is sequenced in such a way that if I throw in a
           record at the wrong time, the song itself makes up for my mistake. The way I've found to get around this
           problem involves some simple arithmatic. I count the number of beats into a song where i think the song
           should "officially" start (usually where the bass, drums, or vocals kick in), then count the beats of the
           track the crowd is hearing, then i throw the new record in at the right time (usually after 48 beats) so
           they'll "drop" at the same time. This little bit of pre-mixing also gives me a second to make sure my
           beats are together, and that i've counted correctly. After its all over, if i've used "The Formula" for the
           powers of good instead of evil, i feel good about the mix, i feel good about the night, and i feel good
           about the world... not to mention my skills... and that's what "The Formula" is all about. There have
           been nights, oh so many nights, when i've been completely off on my timing and the crowd has felt it.
           There have been times on the dance floor when my groove was totally disrupted because of poor timing
           on the DJ's part. It is all about the music, but the music is all about "The Formula". Question... Can
           anybody tell me what "The Formula" is really called? And what it's real purpose is? Let me know at
