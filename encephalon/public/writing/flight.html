what could i have done?<br>
she spoke of him,<br>
and i loved them both<br>
(the better man from long ago)<br>
i had wished things had turned<br>
out differently<br>
but i'd thought that before<br>
and without things turning out<br>
differently<br>
things would not be as they are<br>
now<br>
like it was in early '94<br>
hoping everything would turn out ok<br><br>
i fly up 7 miles in the dark<br>
light bulbs below me<br>
like stars<br>
who last replaced a light bulb<br>
where the one i see shines?<br>
tiny stars all alone<br>
grouped around loose collections<br>
of stars<br>
which are grouped around larger<br>
and larger collections of stars<br>
until the concentration<br>
is so bright i can read by it<br>
and the bulbs stretch to the horizon<br><br>
great cities being orbited<br>
like galaxies and solar systems<br>
natural order<br>
unification on all scales<br>
behind each star?  i don't know<br>
but behind each each bulb below,<br>
there is a door<br>
like the one i left through this<br>
afternoon<br>
and life and love continues<br>
to go on<br>
without me<br>
everywhere
