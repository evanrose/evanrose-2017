<!-- begin entry -->

sitting on a beaten stone<br>
looking out to sea<br>
watching the waves crashing in<br>
wondering where could she be<br>
i think i may have remembered<br>
those long gone times<br>
but they are so long forgotten<br>
all i have are these rhymes<br>
the cold autumn air his my face<br>
blowing away the tears<br>
crying for all the things unseen<br>
all the wasted years<br>
i stand just as night is coming<br>
it all stays the same<br>
slinging on my pack i turn<br>
and leave the way i came
