letters written time and again<br>

looking at chunks of the city<br>
southwest?<br>
haighting from the top of the hill<br>
thinking of you and missing you<br>
wanting- needing to be with you<br>
needing?<br>
sounds all too familiar- at least<br>

bright happy alive, an actress<br>
actress?<br>
i am bitter content survive
-realist you say- "i don't want that"
tell me, please- me (or that) tell me<br>

to- (i would) treat you oh so good<br>
"you can be my momma and i'll<br>
be your boy" god i want to/you<br>
you too?<br>
to touch taste smell there- i said it<br>
but i, you, we, friends,... if not better<br>
"friends.  friends, yeah friends... friends!" and a kiss...<br>

and the buildings, and... hold my hand.<br>

and here i- am trapped in the- middle<br>
darkness- falling i should move- on

meant to me (is) but, but, but, i'm-<br>
(keeping) being (kept)- changed into<br>

the man i want to be- wants you<br>
to be with- to hold and have<br>
i was cold but i see now<br>

a door(ed?)- maybe yours(?)- leads the way<br>
to warmth; part of me wants to go<br>
but always still- part of me wants<br>to stay?
