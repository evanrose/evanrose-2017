her mind is far away<BR>
but her kiss is oh so close<BR>
i am an impartial observer<BR>
to this game we're playing<BR>
but she's got me so fucked up<BR>
she's got me wrapped around her finger<BR>
and i'm loving every minute of it<BR>
<br><BR>
at the coffee shop <BR>
on the corner<BR>
intelectualization burning inside<BR>
the smoke filled room of deception<BR>
the house of caffine and lies<BR>
the young lady behind<BR>
the counter<BR>
looks me dead in my eyes<BR>
leaves me wondering <BR>
what i came here to find<<BR>
<br><BR>
she moves so gracefully<BR>
in spite of the bags<BR>
beneath her bloodshot eyes<BR>
she's got a smile for me<BR>
wanting to drop out<BR>
for a while<BR>
and take her with me
