when i raised my eyes to say enjoy it<br>
i meant it, i wanted you<br>
to be looking back, and you were<br>
it happened twice<br>
i had to catch my breath<br>
that moment was timeless<br>
we were together we were one<br>
we were, forever, in a glance<br>
butterflies in my stomach<br>
maybe i recognized you<br>
in a past life you may have<br>
held a special place in my harem<br>
you may have been a shark<br>
attacking my peaceful school<br>
i might have been a mother<br>
bringing you into this world<br>
seen in one unique way for <br>
one unique moment and most likely<br>
never seen that way again<br>
i've seen you at the store<br>
ahead of me in line<br>
passing in traffic<br>
from a window<br>
and wanted you, never knowing<br>
how to get to you<br>
but there you are, again<br>
not to see me, but i am here<br>
did you feel it?  do you remember?<br>
i think maybe you did<br>
and you knew my name
