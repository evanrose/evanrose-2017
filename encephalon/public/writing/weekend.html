"please don't bother me" <br>
she said at the end<br> 
of her message, and my worrying,<br>
and my weekend.<br>
i never meant to do any harm,<br>
things (just seem to) fall apart.<br>
my job, (secure) my friend, <br>
(expect) my act, (more lies) my plans-<br>
no matter, my trust and my heart<br>
fell apart a long time ago.<br>
there is (a) piece... in this<br>
in the beginning, it was good.<br>
she was good, we were<br>
at the zenith of the weekend.<br>
mind's on one, talking about another,<br>
seeing her!  and sitting across<br>
from the one i wanted to be with-<br>
that night-<br>
she said i'd find her for sure.<br>
because she was out there somewhere
