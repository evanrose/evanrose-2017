where is she? the she i'm looking for<br>
she is not a she, she is an idea, an ideal<br>
for the first time i want her<br>
i don't need her<br>
and i know i don't want her to need me<br>
a prticular her comes to mind<br>
a her i don't know
a her that is life, fire, water, air<br>
she is lightning a roller coaster fear<br>
i have got to have her<br>
it seems too much trouble sometimes<br>
afraid the old pain a darkness<br>
will come out again<br>
i am more me when she is near<br>
i can't i won't i don't want to<br>
but i might miss her<br>
her.  the her the one my one<br>
i want to stick with the own<br>
i'm better off alone anyway<br>
i need to i have to i must<br>
or that feeling will slip away<br>
i'll lose it forever<br>
she will be lost from me forever<br>
so i continue to wait, pretty patiently<br>
but with anticipation.<br>
she might be the next one through the door<br>
when she does, if she does<br>
god i hope i'll be ready<br>
and i hope that she is too<br>
but until then, being me, i'll wait
