well, i wanted to write.  so here i sit, writing.  i've heard that steven king has two secretaries that he dictates to.  how does one
man have so much shit to say?  does he have time to think of himself?  i mean, the man's gotta
make a living, i know, but jesus!  i have enough trouble thinking of myself.<br>
i wanted to write, but i don't know that i have anything new, let alone anything important to say.
i just always seem to have too much on my mind, and if the truth be told would like to never
have to work again, maybe i'll be one of the lucky ones.  it seems as though this fucking typewriter
wouldn't have naything to do with it.
child of the computer age fucking around with this old ass peice of shit.  i must be crazy.  
i must be or i'd not be thinking this shit at all.  i'd be getting up, going to school/work, 
doing my thing, minding my own business, or at least paying my car insurance, all without a thought in my head.  but no!  i want to be famous, respected, admired, appreciated 
(rich) but (but) what do i care?  i guess because i'm sick of having nothing and knowing in
my broken heart of hearts that i deserve more.  so that's why i have this typewriter.  
i'm going to say what i need to if only because i think the world could use one more motherfucker
saying nothing at the top of his lungs.
