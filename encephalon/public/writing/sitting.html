sitting waiting looking all around<br>
at nothing, no one<br>
sitting in the passenger seat<br>
alone<br>
emptiness is crowding me<br>
hot so hot<br>
but i'm handcuffed<br>
and i can't answer the phone<br>
that won't ring<br>
they're too busy<br>
doing nothing<br>
to stop<br>
my lighter is on the floor<br>
in his pocket<br>
and he laughs at me<br>
it hurts<br>
it hurts really bad<br>
paranoia is creeping in<br>
but she looks so<br>
so innocent<br>
she's laughing too<br>
they get in not saying a word<br>
and i feel <br>
like a hitchhiker<br>
that smells<br>
but they say they love me<br>
and its so hot<br>
and they laugh<br>
and laugh
