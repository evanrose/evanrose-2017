that girl<BR>
goddamn that girl<BR>
sometimes i want to kill her<BR>
as she kisses my neck<BR>
such a tight lipped<BR>
cold.................(so hot)<BR>
insensitive..........(so loving)<BR>
heart breaking.......(god i love her)<BR>
bitch.<BR>
hate myself when we part<BR>
hate her the next time we meet<BR>
and "the sex is sooooo good"<BR>
she has no hopes<BR>
no dreams............(but she<BR>
no fears..............knows all<BR>
no feelings...........of mine)<BR>
she gives me <BR>
no encouragement<BR>
no hope<BR>
no clues<BR>
but i'm there when<BR>
she calls<BR>
just like she is <BR>
for me.<BR>
is it love...........thank god<BR>
is it lust...........that it<BR>
is it codependency...isn't love<BR>
if it was i'd kill myself<BR>
and take her with me.<BR>
