is it only when its late at night<BR>
that i get this feeling?<BR>
wondering what its all about<BR>
as i search relentlessly for my lighter<BR>
my dog puts his head in my lap<BR>
its not his love that i want<BR>
i'm so tired of this fucked up place<BR>
i'm looking for life to be a bit quieter.<BR>
i'm hungry, but i do not want to eat<BR>
i smoke, and i know its gonna kill me<BR>
i'm so lonely, but i don't touch the phone<BR>
i'm fucked up.<BR>
"the night is so young" i tell her as she<BR>
hugs me from behind.  oh my god<BR>
she kissed my ear and told me i love...<BR>
i sigh and shudder when i wake up.<BR>
gravel all over the road, the cop<BR>
on the corner looking at me funny.<BR>
i ain't done shit.<BR>
i'm going in circles and my money's at home<BR>
a man told me he loved me yesterday.<BR>
i ate cereal with a man i didn't even know<BR>
i kissed her neck because it smelled so good<BR>
for a minute i wasn't all alone.<BR>
i get this fucked up feeling only when <BR>
its late at night sometimes.<BR>
my tummy's growlin', stereo's screamin' dog's<BR>
whining like the brakes in my car<BR>
i want to cry because i won't wake up.
