updating from stephen's machine in mill valley, just outside of san francisco, 
using (ugh) omniupdate (formerly known as omniedit, note the little balloon below).  
not only does this service insert that fucking balloon (tacky, if you ask me), 
once you've edited your pages, they are completely unreadable unless you update 
through them; i.e. viewing a simple text file with an ftp client makes the code 
look like chinese, or better yet, squashed bugs.  we'll work that out in the long 
overdue redesign, for real.

night before last, after windshield replacement, check collecting, and a little shopping 
at 
<a href="http://www.dallasobserver.com/bod/1999/market/028.html" target="_blank">
ahab bowen</a>, i kicked it with matt (who had just come into town).  over at 
curtis park in the car, we discussed everything from the deal with 
<a href="../stuff/mattandrebecca2.jpg" target="_blank">rebecca</a> 
to jesus to 
my new "oneness"(?) with everything.  it was wonderful, he is one of the few.
<br><br>

yesterday was a mad rush to get here, and after delay after delay (after delay) i 
finally did, and stephen and i caught up until we couldn't catch up any more.  
<br>
<br>
by the 
way, i sent out an update about my leaving, and the emails come pouring in.  i wish 
we could leave forever more often, and i wish being closer wasn't so hard.
