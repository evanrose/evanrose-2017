here is encephalon.org verson 5.5, incorporating some new cgi and ssi skills.  
still looks the same, but sitewide changes and edits will be a breeze.  
<br>
<br>
just as soon as i decide what 
i want to do.

<br>
leaving for dallas tomorrow afternoon, friends, road-trip, wedding, breakfast 
at john's, i'm really really excited.  i can't say i miss the city, but man i 
miss those people.  summer is in full effect, and the younger crowd (daria, 
matt, etc.) is back from school.  oddly enough, i'm ready to go on and get this 
trip over with.  in addition to stressing out over my possible lack of a ticket 
and a ride to the airport and finishing up my time with 
<a href="http://www.gapinc.com" target="_blank">the gap</a> and taking 4.5 days off 
(you know how we do it, and thank god for a five payday month!), i'm ready to get 
back in game out here and get some shit done.  i probably deserve a break though...
<br>
<br>
i sent <a href="http://www.peterme.com" target="_blank">peter</a> an article, 
and not only did i get a <a href="000322.html">link</a>, but got an email back 
imploring why i hadn't told him i was in the bay area now, and why didn't we 
get together(!  apparently, i'm not the only one who reads this website).  i was 
(briefly) reminded of (my brief time in) high school 
when one of the "popular people" would say "what's up" to me and the feeling i 
got.  insecurities die hard, i guess, but i guess my 
<a href="../stuff/lurking.html">"lurking"</a> has paid off.
