<p>like king george of england wrote in his journal on 4 july 1776, 
"nothing of importance happened today" except for, i suppose, 
continuation of mad email newsletter/ email database troubles 
and frustration but the crew was out all day so i went home and 
napped and then cleaned in anticipation of mom's visit tomorrow 
and sundays breakfast with <a href="http://www.peterme.com" target="_blank">peter</a> 
was cool but i didn't make it to the moma (a line around the block) nor 
did i make it to the gallery show in the east bay but (yawn) its 
all very good and certainly very chill oh yes, and gave up a 
<a href="../netscape.html" target="_blank">redesign</a> but added a little something 
<a href="../stuff/index.html" onMouseOver="imageChange('title','alt4','one','graphic1on'); window.status='stuff'; return true" onMouseOut="imageChange('title','alt0','one','graphic1'); window.status=''; return true" onClick=openmain() target="mainopen">new</a> 
and got some <a href="http://www.lozenge.net" target="_blank">props from john</a> 
(nice job by the way, though you know how i feel about "best viewed at 1024x768") 
and that's always really cool - oh yeah, and 
<a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">stephen</a>'s uncle dan came by.</p>
