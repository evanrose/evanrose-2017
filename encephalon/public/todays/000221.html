i just finished another version (5k.02 beta) of the 
<a href="http://www.inthehead.com/product/web/sites/5k/index.html" target="_blank">
site</a> 
that i'm going to enter in the 
<a href="http://www.the5k.org/"  target="_blank">5k competition</a>
<br><br>
a most social day yesterday: breakfast with daria, cory, and laurie, 
where we ran into chris, lee, and andy (who were bike riding), 
then over to terilli's for espresso shots 
where we ran into tony from hagfish, tim from tripping daisy, john 
from bedwetter/deathray davies, andrew (who i worked with at the 
coffee shop for about 15 minutes), and caroline from laurie's party 
last week.  it was like a(nother) cocktail party, and i fantasized about the 
customers there thinking "who is this grubby looking guy who knows 
everybody?".  i felt cool for a second.
<br><br>
i also got my copy of perry-kingsley's 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000000EJ3/encephalon-20" target="_blank">"the end sound from way out"</a>  
on vinyl that daria brought back from montreal, and i got to feel cool
again.

<!-- i hung out with sonya, and we 
tried to out ghetto each other.  she won.  as i walked her to her 
car she said "be sure to tell your mother how sweet and cute i am, 
and that i forced you to have sex with me without a condom..." 
(one more in a succession of mad vibes)  i added "yeah, and mom... 
she's black!"  we laughed.  she'd be my first black girl.
