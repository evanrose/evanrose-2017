after waiting at the airport yesterday from 2 till 730 and a 
flight into the oh so far away san jose (i'm a poet...) i made it 
home at 1215 (215 cst) and except for breakfast at johns with friends, 
<!-- john k, colin, matt and daria --> i watched a whole day slip 
through my fingers and disappear forever.  
<br>
<br>
it was extra hard 'cause today was my first day at 
<a href="http://www.zoza.com" target="_blank">zoza</a>, which turned out 
to be boring and complicated (read: tiring.  did i mention i was sick?)  
it sucked - but definately has potential...

<!-- did i mention 20,000 options? -->

<br>
<br>
so tonight is all about paperwork and paying bills (with a very 
hefty retainer check!) and messing with my brand 
new dual band vibrating 
web browsing personal digital assistant assed 
<a href="#" title="415-637-2580">cell phone</a>!
<br>
<br>
oh, dallas was so rad; friends, fun, good eating, good times, lots of 
laughs and hugs and stuff... i had so much fun i got sick and i am 
so glad to be home.  pictures and details coming when i'm less tired 
and less busy.  interestingly, i didn't spen any time alone 
and the only time not part of a  big group 
(which i used to hate) was when lindsey h. and i had 
dinner at the mansion while daria was at rehearsal dinner. i guess it made 
<a href="000612.html">saying goodbye</a> to her all that much easier.

<!--
she's going back to montreal in 6 days.  i can't stand it 
that i can't stand it when she talks about mark or anyone else.  
i can't stand it that i'm so close to something almost perfect 
that i want so badly yet sooooo far away.

yes, i'm talking about you, and thankfully, how i fell is my business.
