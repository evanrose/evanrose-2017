just got back from dinner and drinks with 
<a href="http://www.peterme.com" target="_blank">peter</a>, which was 
excellent. wonderful conversation, fresh perspective, looking forward to the next time.  
it was very strange though, that i already knew about alot of what we ended up 
talking about.  i have a lot of thinking to do about my 
<a href="../stuff/milan.html">theories</a> and <a href="../stuff/lurking.html">pilosophies</a> 
concerning people and the web and communication and new media 
<br>
<br>
and shit.
<br>
<br>
speaking of weirdness and people who's websites i read every day, 
<a href="http://www.kottke.org" target="_blank">jason</a>'s been talking about 
<a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/meme.html" target="_blank">memes</a> 
this week and i sent him an email detailing the fact that i had learned 
about the superfriends <a href="http://www.whassup.com" target="_blank">whassup movie</a> 
moments after it went up, but it took me another 2 months to learn it was a budweiser 
commercial, and to this day, i've never seen it.
<br>
<br>
these random and isolated events were not my first brush with weirdness this week; oh no.  after a 
day of working on my (first!) flash project, and registering for school, and 
getting my liscence and registration, the phone man came out and spent an hour 
tearing apart every jack in the house, then told me that my only option for running 
another line in here was to run it around the house and through the window.  so he 
proceeded to give me 150 feet of real deal phone wire, a jack, and detailed instructions 
on how to do it (red on red, green on green), told me he wasn't going to bill me, then 
bode me farewell.  fight the power.
<br>
<br>
even weirder than that was seeing "the angel" (! - insert cory's the angel voice here - and 
he is going to shit!), lila, in
mill valley with her mom.  

<!-- 
how approprate - i see the girl who's trash cory dug through to find out who she 
was, and i have no desire to call him and tell him anything.  pukebag.
-->

tell you what - unearthing this dallas relic was a hell of alot 
better than the <a href="000614.html">last one</a>.

<!-- 
interestingly enough, on the way home listened to love line and heard 
a guy talk about his opiate addiction, and was granted a moment of gratitude
-->

<br>
<br>
expectedly (for a change), our thinking about a trip to london in october has come 
to an end.  i was looking forward to the possibility of seeing <a href="000705.html">her</a>

<!-- and what i wouldn't do to see her agian -->
 
again, but now i can concentrate on spring vacation ideas that 
<a href="000621.html">my girls have inspired</a>, 

<!-- 
i've been thinking for a while about two weeks in spain (bilboa, madrid, barcelona), 
vienna, and prague, but now mom's trying to convince me to roll to krakow of all 
places.  we'll see - europe is definately on my horizon

just like san francisco was

and in the meantime, maybe some web stuff.
