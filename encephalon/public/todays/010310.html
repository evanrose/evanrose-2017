<p>
after a day of non work and rootbeer floats i've spent the evening hanging out and updating 
<a href="http://www.inthehead.com" target="_blank">in the head</a> and thinking about 
a new place and a new website and while waiting for evan d. to come into town and 
while waiting i picked up some old journals, one from a period of time begun 
just before my first trip to see <a href="../writing/nonfiction.html">nicola</a> and 
continuing on through my first cigarette and first time getting stoned, then 
found another that detailed some of the "salad" days with 
<a href="../writing/thatgirl.html">danette</a> that i ended up only adding my perceptions 
of the night that she told me she loved me and then the day 2.5 months later when 
she "broke up with me" and i'm remembering those times so clearly that sometimes 
seem like so long ago, and yeah, they were a long time ago and i forget the 
horrible wreckage life was after my experiences with both of those women - the 
times i didn't write about - descent into drug addiction and dropping out of high school 
and living on the streets and then 2.5 years later loss of motivation and self esteem 
and jobs and cars and friends and contemplation of suicide as i continued to try being 
with her while being driven totally mad by her selfishly evil ways (or so 
i considered them at the time, my time of seeing the other side of the coin 
always comes at some point) and then... regrowth 
and even though i sometimes think about and wonder about the sort of things that 
were on my mind and topics of conversation in those days and who i was then and now that i 
think about it further, seeing 
as how my time in late 97 and early 98 was filled with putting pieces of my life back together 
and now, the person i am and the things i do are so radically different that my life 
is unrecognizeable, even to myself sometimes - and thinking about the roads i've been 
down and, inevetably, the road i'm on right now seems to still be heading off into 
the direction i set for myself then and even though my questioning the validity and 
importance of that road <a href="010227.html">not long ago</a> no longer matters as the road only 
leads back to myself - changing my perceptions of the past and thereby changing both the 
way i deal with the present as well as what i see ahead and its times like this, times 
of excitement, newness and growth, that 
i'm really glad i started writing things down again.
