the real story can be found if you know the secret code...
<br>
<br>
wait a second, i was supposed to be good to go after 
<a href="000117.html">sunday night</a>; 
the problem is where 
it always is though... in my head.
<br>
<br>
so i dropped physics, couldn't get into photoshop, felt like a loser, 
didn't have the dinner at dave's, been a little nutty, talking on the 
phone, alot.  daria's quit smoking (and i'm her new smoke sponsor) and 
people are coming back from vacation, cory's sick, and...
<br>

<!-- 
none of these people are the one i want to talk to.  it's all 
good, of course, and i have spoken to her, my expectations are low, 
and the control i'd wished i'd had two years ago i have now, 
but feelings for her i think i put a cap on 2 months ago have 
resurfaced, as well as an addiction that i'd forgotten about.  
one things for sure, our friendship did not (and i don't think it has 
to) change, but i think i'm now thinking that i'd like it to.

i think that's about all i know.
