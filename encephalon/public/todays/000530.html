cory and his friends from l.a. tom and brad came into town this 
weekend, and mad good times and drama ensued.

<!-- 
tom and cory's friendship is ruined, and i'm even more glad 
he's there, and i'm here.
-->

we ate good: basta pasta in north beach, and the burrito place 
in the height, we laughed, we saw the sights, and don't forget 
the crazy yo-yo salesman who took us way too seriously!
<br>
<br>

i start at <a href="http://www.gap.com" target="_blank">
the gap dot com</a> tomorrow, but have more work than i can deal with 
now.  i'm really glad though, that everything has come together 
so beautifully, and i'm getting exactly what i wanted from coming here.  
and i finnu get paid!
<br>
<br>

yeah, its cool, and so is this redesign, huh?

<br>
<br>
kind of irrelevant when i no longer have anything other than work 
to talk about.  finally.
