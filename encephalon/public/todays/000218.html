points to poder: web journals.  fucking weird if you ask me.  
i was read through <a href="http://www.coygirl.com" target="_blank">
coygirl</a>'s site, and she questioned her putting her life in words 
for anyone to see.  my take on this is that there are some things i 
want people to see, and some things i don't.  it's 
<I>&lt;!-- all here --&gt;</I> though, 
and certainly, none of it matters anyway.    
i'll tell anyone anything, but its the information 
that's heard over the phone or in person by certain special people that 
matters the most.  
<br><br>
finding random journals on the web is cool, its like a cocktail party.  
i catch someone at their wittiest, then never 
see them again.  i certainly can leave a card (in the form of an 
email), but usually that's it (except for the real life parties 
i've been going to recently!).  its cool, i like it, and if nothing 
else, i get to see some interesting sites and get a different take on 
take. 
<br><br>
another point is that i'm trying to get a web job at the moment.  
if just from this site, its obvious that i'm not stupid, i'm a 
good learner, and can at least work a good game.  i personally 
value these qualities in a person, because i meet so few people 
who have them.  
<br><br>
i could just suck and just don't know it, but i doubt it.  
<br><br>
maybe 
everyone else just sucks.

i spoke to r. on the phone today and it reminded me of 
<a href="../writing/laundry.html">lara</a>, 
which definately sucked.
