had a fabulous time having drinks the other night with 
<a href="http://www.dallasobserver.com/issues/1999-06-03/music4.html" target="_blank">
earl harvin</a>, talking about music and classic cars... its so nice to be with someone 
who i respect and admire, and 
so likeable.  matt was excited too:  earl is going 
to record him this summer.  
i'm very busy!!!  working on two sites for two "clients" 
(drowse and the haus) at the moment, 
though it'll be a while before they go live.  
<br>
<br>
i wonder what people were thinking when they stocked up on y2k shit.  did they believe that 
they would be allowed to "survive" in their own homes if there was no power anywhere?  
the masses are too trusting and foolish... but on a lighter note, i just got an 
email from simona!
