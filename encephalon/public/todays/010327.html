hung with <a href="http://www.ruthie-media.com" target="_blank">jen</a> on saturday 
and saw <a href="http://www.artlic.com/films/taste.html" target="_blank">the taste of others</a> and 
saw the excellent 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6300270912/encephalon-20/104-2736877-9287905" target="_blank">after hours</a> 
last night but other than that, i've not been doing or feeling much lately, which is nice, 
- not very good for my emotive written output, merely peacefully placing 
<a href="http://www.thefarside.com/" target="_blank">"the far side"</a> 
calandar (a gift) pages into 
my paper recycling bag every morning when i pour my first cup of coffee knowing 
each each time that there are fewer and fewer pages i'll have to remove before 
i'm again in dallas taking care of unfinished business but the meantime has 
provided an environment that's been extremely conducive to work as well as my 
relation to it - <a href="http://inthehead.com" target="_blank">inthehead.com</a>'s 
new functionality with php, a big crud (create read update delete) project 
with oracle in java at 
<a href="http://www.zoza.com?msc=encephalon_haha" target="_blank">work</a> 
which i feel better and better about every day, no matter how close at hand 
the end happens to be, and after 
reading a whole bunch of articles and continuing down a line of thought about the 
<a href="http://joel.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$139" target="_blank">evil ways and scary plans by microsoft</a>, 
i have been continuing to think about 
giving up my wintel development environment for linux (along with fantasies of 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html" target="_blank">emacs</a> and 
<a href="http://www.opera.com/linux/" target="_blank">opera</a> as well as my own 
<a href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_blank">apache web server</a>...), 
forsaking all things microsoft, 
right down to my (sorta) trusty old (as hell) hotmail.com email address - along 
with that i've been dreaming of a vast interconnected network that i've 
<a href="000708.html">spoken of before</a> and know that its just a matter of time, which i 
have plenty of and more to spare; this promises to be a long road, and 
work which of course is its own reward.
