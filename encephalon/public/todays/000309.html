goodness, way too much.  yesterday in reverse chronological order:
<br>
<br>
laughed out loud reading the silliest shit on the web; paperclips, 
big foot, "he has the same name as me", 
<a href="http://www.myleftasscheek.com" target="_blank">myleftasscheek.com</a> 
(still chuckling over that one). feeling great too. 
<br><br>
came home abso-fucking-lutely fucking furious. 
<br><br>
was only able to take 1/2 of an algebra mid-term. 
<br><br>
caught a bus after i missed the first one by mere moments, and 
was an hour and 15 minutes late for school. 
<br><br>
lamented while waiting for the bus the fact that i'm paying 1900 
dollars ($US) over the course of 
this month and last for my car (insurance, payment, deductible), while 
it rots in the shop and i have to ride the bus. 
<br><br>
flirted obscenely and openly (not to mention randomly). 
<br><br>
<!--carolyn, who's coming over tomorrow night, and (girl) tony... -->

officially got the coffee haus website contract (we're talkin' money, 
fool). 
<br><br>
sent out my update of the launch of <a href="http://www.inthehead.com" target="_blank">
inthehead.com</a>, which was so cool i decided to open it in this 
frame.  i'm feeling silly.

<br><br>

<!-- 
i felt so silly that i emailed an update to 
	<a href="000117.html" target="_window">
misty</a> 
and 
	<a href="000212.html" target="_window">
renee</a>, (view sources)
neither of whom i'm in communication with (for various reasons), i guess 
maybe to see if they'd reply.  misty did, and i got sad.  being 
not "in communication" with them makes me 
	<a href="000306.html">
sad</a> (view source) 
too.

full circle, non-stop
