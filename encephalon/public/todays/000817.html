1. sunshine, cool breeze, phone and bottle of water between my legs, 
<a href="http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/artists/amontobin/index2.html" target="_blank">supermodified</a> 
really really loud.  2. enter the rise of a hill, gaining on the slowpoke all up in the fast lane 
ahead, meanwhile he's passing somone in the lane to our right, i slide from fifth into 
fourth, ease out the clutch.  3. as just enough space opens up between slowpoke and the 
car to our right, i ease on the gas and let the clutch out completely, the road begins to curve to the left.  
4. i look slowpoke in the face (his profile, actually, he has no clue he is the reason 
there's so much traffic on the road) and as we round the curve, i judge the distance between 
the front of slowpokes car and the car i've just realized is in front of me, moving very slowly.  5. the curve is straightening, 
slowpoke's slowing, and as i see my tachometer pass 3500, i decide to wake him up a bit; 
6. so i slip in front of him with inches to spare, top the crest, straighten out, clutch in, fifth gear, clutch out, 
and slide on down the road.

right this instant, that's what life feels like, except i'm at step four.  cool, because things 
are coming, not cool because things aren't happening yet.  2 days at 
<a href="http://www.xuma.com" target="_blank">xuma</a> in the city (and not checking my email)
trying to figure out <a href="http://www.zoza.com" target="_blank">our site</a> and 
getting into school (to the tune of 1175$ with 30 minutes to spare) which starts on monday, 
and i'm feeling like i'm coming down with something.  
<br>
<br>
it is all good.
<br>
<br>
and still very weird.  i've just begun noticing all of the many many (many) wierd things that 
are going on, kind of similar to all of the <a href="000401.html">signs</a> i was seeing 
this spring, except i haven't yet seen any sort of pattern.  after the psychic stuff with 
don (and micheal) <a href="000815.html">the other day</a>, and then guessing correctly (knowing?) where 
american gothic is located, etc. etc. etc., i got a call from evan d. 
<!-- danziger, who got me to barbados to meet <a href="../writing/nonfiction.html">nicola</a> -->
who i hadn't spoken to in 4 (or more?) years.  he might even be rolling out here soon.
<br>
<br>
so after coming to terms with myself and weirdness 
(which isn't vicariousness, but my actual real-life) and pondering what is going on and what 
is coming up (which certainly makes little or no difference to anyone 
but me - and my mom), not to mention 2 fucking hours worth of email 
(well, maybe somebody cares...), i'm orange juice and bedding it.
