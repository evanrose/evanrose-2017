remember: i never know until i ask.  i'm only going to live once.  
i only have today.  i'm better than i think i am.

i'm already getting hungry thinking about dinner tonight, my mom and i have been invited 
to dave and maryanne's for steak and fixin's... maryanne is one of the world's
 finest cooks, as well as the head pastry chef at dallas' new "ciudad", a five 
star mexican eatery owned by monica, of monica's fame.

school starts tomorrow night- i'm thinking of taking photoshop instead of 
physics, 
<br>
<br>
'cause i'm all about making sense.
<br>
<br>

spell; oh it was so fine...

<!-- 
some of the sweetest, free-est, and most comfortable 
i've ever had: thanks, m.  pretty odd considering 
our conversation in 
<a href="991115.html">

at everything else i do.
