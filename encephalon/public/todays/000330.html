ok.  breathe.  deeply.  
<br>
<br>
coming down to the wire (so to speak) is forcing me to look at my 
recent goings on very objectively (without fear), yet organizing and 
prioritizing in such a way (for maximized personal benefit) seems to 
be the most subjective thing i could do.  maybe i'm just thinking 
*correctly*.  

<!-- 
i ran into <a href="000117.html">
misty on tuesday evening.  it was ok, though the more i think about it, 
the more i think she has to do with alot of what's going on right now.
-->
<br>
<br>
there is so much exciting new stuff on the horizon, and 
i'm so close to being scared shitless about it; i guess i'm still in 
the frame of mind i was in when i left <a href="http://www.edanz.com" target="_blank">
edanz</a>.  that mindset was no plans, no worries, no fear, which was 
new for me.  like i told daria last night: "everything matters less and 
less as time goes on."  when nothing matters, anything is possible.
<br>

<!-- 
speaking of daria, we are talking about my coming up there for a 
weekend soon, and possibly europe this summer...  and why not?
-->

<br>
wonderful emails from <a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">
stephen</a>, colin, and <a href="http://www.zeldman.com" target="_blank">
jeffrey z.</a>, i love them good vibes!  

<!-- he called me the popup window king.  how fucking cool is that?-->

and speaking of good vibes, 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004S5DG/encephalon-20" target="_blank">"on the floor at the boutique"</a> (fatboyslim dj mix) is superduper cool.
<br>
<br>
like i told stephen when i was <a href="vacation1199.html">
out there last</a>, "its all about constant reorganization of priorities, 
and doing the next right thing".  kinda redundant, i know.

<!-- 
sigh.  
and keep praying for courage and faith.  if i'd ever known 
being a grownup was this crazy and this scary and this confusing on 
all levels, i at least would have prepared for it better.
