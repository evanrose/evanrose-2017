chance meetings are cool like running into stephen on the street on the way to lunch 
from training at <a href="http://www.xuma.com" target="_blank">xuma</a> yesterday 
(though we ended up at 26 mix again 
with the crew last night - maybe not that random), 
as is hearing from <earl> about his coming 
with the the <a href="000518.html">again</a> soon (and his subsequent talking to daria about their 
montreal show and my subsequent catching up with her) then about cory's 
chance meeting with <a href="../writing/hermind.html">danette</a> and his telling her all about what's going 
on with me (and buttering it up nicely) which i had actually been thinking about 
recently; i.e. whether or not she knew i was out here and about our 
<a href="000411.html">reversal 
of destinies</a>, etc. etc. etc. but in the meantime all i can think about between 
mad training and even madder schoolwork (and an hour and a half of email and 
"<a href="000322.html">catching up</a>" tonight) is what i'm going to do with this site next 
like i've been thinking i'd like to get a redesign up for my move, but also thinking 
about going to a monthly blogger sort of deal and some interesting background 
effects and some different navigation and maybe even starting with the recent 
change in format but i'm just too stinking busy and i think i'd rather spend the 
time learning some new shit to get all frustrated over than  "hmmm, maybe i'll 
make my site xhtml4.0 compliant!" but of course, its a work in progress, and 
for now i don't know about progress, but i'm sure as hell working.
