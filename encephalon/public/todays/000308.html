this</a> is what i did yesterday, and i mean all day too.  it took 
forever, images all wrong (over and over again) - stinking friends 
coming over and bothering me...

<br><br>
<!-- 
tyler and matt l. came by at different points in the day, i didn't 
step foot outside untill after 11 pm 
-->

and it still looks like shit.  sigh.

<br><br>
i've been doing some thinking about the web, for a change, thinking of 
email conversations with <a href="http://www.coygirl.com" target="_blank">
coygirl</a> and others, thinking of the 
<a href="000218.html">cocktail party effect</a>, 
thinking about letters i've written, and emails i write and continue 
to write... 
<br>
<br>
and then i think about all those people out there, and how far away 
they are.
<br>
<br>

which isn't so bad!  i told matt l. (who's leaving for jersey in a month) 
last night that the thought of distance (leaving) hasn't been crossing 
my mind because i've been so happy lately, so at peace.  i mentioned 
that once i had *felt* happy long enough i would decide to go.  i know 
time and life and people don't matter, i just don't *believe* it yet.

<!-- and i got blown off last night!  what an attitude... -->
