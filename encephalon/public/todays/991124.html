san francisco was awesome; could it be any other way?  i knew it would be.  <a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">stephen</a> and i had many a good conversation, and 
hatched several a plan, and generally had a fine time, a full report of the trip will be forthcoming...  in montreal now, tired as hell, just ate a great tibetan meal with <a href="http://members.tripod.com/evanrose/Daria.htm" target="_blank">daria</a>.
 daria and i have been smoking and talking and smoking and catching up and smoking- montreal is turning out to be much more than i thought it was... more will be revealed.<br>
stephen and i were talking about the hows and whys of our "success" (so far) and i decided that i couple a bit  of extra daily maintainence with my usual daily self distruction, thereby 
eventually leaving myself a bit of room to play with- and a constant reorganization of priorities.  thank god for good friends and good timess.
