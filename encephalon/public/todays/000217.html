i don't know if i like this r. girl.  i don't know if 
trying to be like cory is good for me.  doing the next right thing 
is proving very difficult right now, what with calling these girls, 
looking for a job, quitting smoking, and all that.  i don't know 
how my faith is at the moment, and i don't know why.
