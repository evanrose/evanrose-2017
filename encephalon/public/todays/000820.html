oh yes, i'm feeling very excited.  i knew good things were on their way!  actually, 
they're still on their way; i'll know alot more on tuesday when my credit check comes back...
<br>
<br>
it probably has something to do with my watching ferris beuller's day off and 
the breakfast club back to back last night.  those movies have a way of making me 
think about people and places and possibilities, and getting little warm fuzzies in general.
<br>
<br>
i found myself in quite a mood today, so good that after breakfast and 
kicking it with <a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">stephen</a> and 
<a href="http://www.hyperreal.org/music/artists/tetsu/" target="_blank">tetsu</a>, i 
decided to get lost driving home.  my intent was to drive from mill valley to novato 
without getting on 101, but instead found a beautful forested windy moutain roadway 
that begins at the highschool in m.v. and dead ends into the 
<a href="http://www.marin.cc.ca.us/" target="_blank">college of marin</a>, where i'll 
be starting school (biology, biology lab, astronomy) tomorrow.  my office is on 
the deadend's crossroad as well, so come september 15th, i might have a new (and 
very lovely) route to work.  
<br>
<br>
i spoke to larkin up until a few minutes ago, and i found out all about her time at 
<a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">oxford</a>, her time in kansas city, and her 
leather pants and we hatched some plans for the upcoming 
holiday season (i'd really like to spend thanksgiving in montreal 
<a href="vacation1199.html">again</a>, but dallas'll do if i can't) and beyond 
(she's thinking of 
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">stanford</a> for grad school, and if that happens, 
<a href="http://www.lozenge.net" target="_blank">john</a> will be out too).
<br>
<br>  
we'll get the crew out here yet, because no matter 
how good this place is to me, i can't help but miss those people (so badly sometimes).

(with associated text about each level - though a bit choppy in the middle) 
always helps me put things in perspective.
