she came out and we got our long weekend on, north beach and dinner at 
<a href="http://bayarea.citysearch.com/profile/917536/" target="_blank">mario's</a>, 
the mission and seeing 
<a href="http://www.baisemoilesite.com/home.htm" target="_blank">baise moi</a>, 
the haight and amoeba after 
breakfasts at the sunnyside cafe, then monday to stinson beach - then 
she missed the rock and roll night at fuse, we saw 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005IC2H/encephalon-20/107-1507385-1541351" target="_blank">sigur ros</a> 
and had 
a vegan dinner party with 
<a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">stephen</a> 
(who is having some personal troubles at the mo') 

<!-- he and trish have decided to break up after 3.5 years together -->

when she decided to extend her stay by 
5 days and we got to part slowly, then come back together again (and again) while 
we discussed what has become of 
<a href="010227.html">the idea</a> which 
includes my job offer from chris, our time exploring in oakland and 
checking out the space there, our educations, our need for health and our 
desire to build something together that is greater than ourselves, activism and 
domesticity, collective and colaborative living and working, creating and building  
(<a href="010419.html">roads converging</a> indeed), as well as simple 
personal concerns, fears, dreams and desires that just sometimes need to be 
acknowledged and it was wonderful, it continues to be wonderful and after 
hauling ass to san jose this morning only to miss the flight i'm back at 
home to get some work done before going back to dallas (one last time, heh) in a 
few days, then waiting and preparing then finally, what i've already been doing 
the whole time but had no idea (and still have no idea) just how good it could be, 
living.
