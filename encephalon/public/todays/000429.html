i blew off coffee with frank this morning, and thinking about it 
as i lay in bed (after sleeping more than i had in a long time) i 
felt like i did when i woke up back in 93 and 94.  its kind of 
silly thinking about it that way because i can't describe the feeling, 
though i think maybe its a combination of guilt and loss, but knowing 
that that's ok.  
<br>
time marches on.
<br>
<br>
speaking of guilt and loss, i've sold almost everything out of my 
apartment, and the only things left in here are things i'm taking with 
me, and the sofa and chair <a href="http://www.lozenge.net" target="_blank">
john</a> is coming to get tomorrow.  i'm going to miss my bed 
alot, i believe; thinking of when and where i got it (out of a 
dumpster in the fall of '94"), and of all the people that i've shared 
it with... sigh.
<br>
time marches on.
<br>
<br>
now comes a week of work and squeezing in friends to say goodbye to, 
making plans and dreaming dreams, and thinking of my new life which 
is about to begin.  but first, perhaps i'll drink another cup of 
coffee and think about seeing <I>the virgin suicides</I> this 
evening before i go spin another house party for shane.  laughing 
out loud and hugging myself...
<br>
time marches on.
