<p>while trying to check my email over at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com" target="_blank">hotmail.com</a> 
(its down, as is msn.com and microsoft.com - i know i know - my desire to be microsoft free is 
seriously hampered by the fact that i've had a hotmail email address for so long that my password 
is four charachters long - its just infuriating to watch emails pour in through msIM [shit!] 
and not be able to check them) i'm thinking very seriously about 
<a href="000702.html">writing a letter</a> about the troubles i've had getting my school shit together instead; an appointment with a counselor that was put off until 9am monday which turned into 945 monday where he told me all sorts of things about admissions to 
<a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">berkeley</a> that i hadn't known before and all the 
knowledge he was able to impart added up to the fact that not only did he not know how i'd go about 
getting in, he had no idea what i should do for this semester so in the last five minutes of our 
terribly long consultation he recommended a language (which had been taken care of by high school 
credits - at least in texas) and another math (statistics - whos requirement had just been taken 
care of before i got out here and oh god!  not another math!) so french it was which started tonight and an 
<a href="http://www.marin.cc.ca.us/~lansing/math/Statistics_ontheNet/" target="_blank">online(!) statistics course</a> 
that'll start at some point - and don't forget a meeting with 
berkeley as soon as possible (sigh) so before i get my red tape on, as it were, i can revel in memories 
of sunday when mo (of chris and mo) was in town and 
<a href="http://www.neimanmarcus.com" target="_blank">neiman's</a> took us to dinner at the 
oh so fabulously expensively delicious 
<a href="http://www.cypressclub.citysearch.com/" target="_blank">cypress club</a> and seeing 
<a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">stephen</a> spin down at 
<a href="http://www.travelape.com/sanfrancisco/nightlife/126/" target="_blank">fuse</a> on monday and 
thankfully, simple just keeps getting <a href="../google.gif" target="_blank">simpler</a>.</p>
