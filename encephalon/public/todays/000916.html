Thank god this week is over with (though i have received over the course of this week 
such excellent bits of news as <a href="../stuff/jason.html">jason</a>'s trip being back on, 
micah's upcoming trip and subsequent move out here, and another 
<i>&lt;!-- as yet unnamed individual --&gt;</i> 's possible upcoming move) 
and i can't believe how nice it was to get as much 
sleep as i did last night after going to and from san jose for 
<a href="http://www.interwoven.com" target="_blank">interwoven</a> training all week and school 
and up to novato and all over the place, even yesterday coming back to the office to 
catch up on a weeks worth of email and going back to the city for 
 seti's going away get together 
at <a href="http://zagat.com/search/detail.asp?localeID=30&partner=0&ID=16503" target="_blank">mecca</a> and the 
<a href="http://bayarea.citysearch.com/E/V/SFOCA/2024/79/47/" target="_blank">soulside's show</a> 
at bimbo's and finally getting home at 2 a.m. and 
i really don't remember being as exausted and braindead and sore as i was last night but this 
morning, oh this morning i woke up in my 3 day old apartment in beautiful 
<a href="http://www.gomillvalley.com" target="_blank">mill valley</a> that i moved into 
on wednesday (and now that i think about it, i took the day off on wednesday to move but 
that proved harder than any other day this week) and it was wonderful looking up at the 
douglas firs that are *right outside* my bedroom window and going into *my* kitchen for 
coffee and opening *my* front door to let some light and air in and then *walking* down 
to the post office for my mail and new copy of 
<a href="http://www.wired.com" target="_blank">wired</a> 
and coming back and now i sit on one of my two pieces of furniture at one of my other 
of two pieces of furniture and i'm thinking that its about time for me to get into the 
shower and get busy with domestication and it is so good to be home.

same spin on my day today.
