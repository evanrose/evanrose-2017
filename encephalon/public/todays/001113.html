<p>my flair for the dramatic and my love (love? it must be) for pseudo... well, drama 
hasn't stopped me from being very very calm the past week - very peaceful which i 
believe is what i've wanted the whole time - i guess it took a little taste to 
remember that i not only want the best, but that i deserve the best and will not 
settle for less than the best - at least for a little while, but this is all bound 
to change tomorrow as i'm thinking of returning the watch tomorrow and telling her 
one <a href="000921.html">last story</a> - its all up in the air and daria called 
yesterday wondering 
what it was that i was trying to 
<a href="001109.html">say about her</a> (a bit cryptic, isn't it?) and she 
remains clueless in the face of a huge neon billboard of naked people that's been 
set on fire - but that's a whole 'nother story, one that will continue in much the 
same fashion here in 7.5 days when i touch down in 
<a href="http://www.tourism-montreal.org/" target="_blank">montreal</a> for a weeks vacation 
and she told me all the things i've heard so many times before - "go for it", 
"you have so much love to give", "that's just how relationships are"... and that's why i'm 
not in one because then as is now, i would rather be alone than deal with something 
that frustrates or hurts me (because it does and has really badly 
<a href="000205.html">before</a>) and 
i don't need anyone and i can stand tall - me against the world... as i think of 
being held and being loved and loving back and looking forward to seeing both of 
them again for whatever reason and for whatever happens next.</p>
