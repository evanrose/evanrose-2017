<p>&gt;feedback from renee at r@mail.com at http://</p>

<p>&gt;It's been awhile-my fault.</p></p>

<p>yep...</p>

<p>&gt;We make ourselves a place apart<br>
&gt;Behind light words that tease and flout,<br>
&gt;But oh, the agitated heart<br>
&gt;Till someone finds us really out.</p>

<p>unless the place apart has been opened to the public and the "light words"
have been transformed into a letter to each and every person who happens to
stumble onto them, welcoming and inviting back.</p>

<p>&gt;'Tis pity if the case require<br>
&gt;(Or so we say) that in the end<br>
&gt;We speak teh literal to inspire<br>
&gt;The understanding of a friend.</p>

<p>huh?  a bit more vague than i remember frost to be...</p>

<p>&gt;But so with all, from babes that play<br>
&gt;At hide-and-seek to God afar,<br>
&gt;So all who hide too well away<br>
&gt;Must speak and tell us where they are.</p>

<p>interesting.  makes me wonder who is the one who's hiding, and i often where
they are as well.</p>
