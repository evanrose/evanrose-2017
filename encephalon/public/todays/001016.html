<p>another weekend and another monday has passed by, and though i got 
to spin <a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">stephen</a>'s party 
at the <a href="http://www.hotelmetropolis.com/" target="_blank">metropolis</a> 
on friday night, i'm yet another week closer to the holiday season i'm so 
looking forward to as in trips back to montreal for thanksgiving and 
dallas for christmas, oh i miss the homies so much but this weekend 
mom was out and we've garagesaled and antiquestored like mad people and 
she's gotten me so much shit including an amazing chair that i'm going 
to have to redecorate my entire apartment around, but all in due time and 
its been wonderful to see her and spend time with her as i've come to the 
realization over the past year that my relationship with her is the 
most important and wonderful one i could possibly have at this stage in life; 
as i am going out into the world and becoming my own entity and unit of 
adulthood, she's always there to light the way and prod me on, but she's also 
there to bring me in from the cold and take care of me when i need it - there has 
never been and will never be anyone who loves me completely and totally, 
unconditionally, without strings or reason like my mother has, will, and does 
right now, which makes me want to be all that much for her, to respect and honor 
her faith and investment in me - for our friendship, because 
it might not have been because of <a href="000318.html">my past</a> actions 
and attitude and also because there are 
<a href="http://www.zeldman.com/glamorous/glamorous10.html" target="_blank">so many</a> 
who don't have what i have, i am truly grateful.</p>
