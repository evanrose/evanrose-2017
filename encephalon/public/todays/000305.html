work work work, that's all you ever do.  how many times have i heard 
that?  more than i care to count.  whenever i hear it, i think "oh 
yeah, i got some friends, and its a nice day, i should call somebody 
and get out of the house!"  some of my recent dealings with certain 
people remind me why i stay at home and work so much.

renee has decided... something, i don't know, the point is is that 
she has decided not to call me anymore.  
its odd because that's totally not the direction this deal was going. 
"hey beautiful", "you can do anything", "i'm going to grab my 
toothbrush, and i'll see you soon"...
thank god i don't feel like i 
	<a href="000124.html">
did	</a>.  
its for the best, as i was way too caught up in that ass.

this weekend i worked, out in public, it was really nice being on my 
feet all day, dealing with people, then coming home absolutely 
exausted.  it reminded of me that there's life beyond this computer 
screen.

<br><br>
it's 9 am on a sunday and 
i really wanted to put this up on the web, 
but ws_ftp ain't having it.  

<br><br>
it is a beautiful day today, too.

<a href="http://www.coygirl.com">coygirl</a> kinda 
did the same shit.  maybe they're source code readers, i don't know, 
but i've been talking to this julie person and analyzing email 
conversations with strangers.  i can't help but think of 
<a href="http://www.ampersand-lounge.com/">richard</a>'s 
"sleeping[ing] with... groupies"...
