experimentation is the key.  when dealing with one's life, one's love, 
one's modus operandi, and especially when dealing with (this) one's website.
<br>
<br>
things are happening very slowly at the moment, a relative comparison when 
stacked against <a href="000618.html">last weekend</a>, but i find myself 
getting sleepier and sleepier, earlier and earlier.  learning alot + an 
almost 4 hour a day commute = being tired.  (stifled yawn)
<br>
<br>
some interesting shake-ups are occuring with 
<a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">stephen, geoff and 
i</a>, 

<!-- 
dealing with stephen has been kind of a pain of late - reminding me of working (or 
trying to work) with cory.  this has made my prospects and my position here very 
interesting.  however, the crew remains.  be sure to check out the link of today...
-->

and i'm thinking we're finally going to get some 
<a href="http://www.inthehead.com/" target="_blank">work</a> done; 
because 

<blockquote>
its all about, sending the emails, getting the clients, building the websites, and 
making the money.  
</blockquote>

unfortunately, thats sometimes a hard notion to grasp.

<a href="000612.html">daria</a> and larkin called me at 
<a href="http://www.gapinc.com" target="_blank">work</a> today 
from prague 
(that's in the czeck republic) and it was so rad hearing from them; bubbly and happy, 
sending salutations over the sea.  
<br>
<br>
goddamn i miss them.  i find i'm missing alot of people these days.
<br>
<br>
jason b.'s coming in town tomorrow night, i gave him directions from the airport 
all the way to the people's cafe, where i'm meeting him at seven.   apparently, 
he has "news" for me, 

<!-- he wants me to come back to texas to work for him.  

i've set a retainer, and a number.  if he's willing, so am i.

yeah, i'm fucking crazy.  so whachoo wanna do?-->
