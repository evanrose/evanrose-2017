how silly is this?  

<!-- i mean, its getting funny about how well things are working out -->

i don't know.  this week has been madening - freelance work, work for 
<a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">stephen</a>, 
then an interview with <a href="http://www.homebuilder.com" target="_blank">
homebuilder.com</a> (by the way, i got the job); gearing up, baby...

<!-- 
and i can't wait to tell them "no!", though in writing this, i'm reminded of the 
article that was the "link of the day" from 
<a href="000425.html">04-25-00</a>
<br>
fuck it though.

<br>
<br>
the most 
amazing thing that's happened recently was the dinner i cooked last night for 
<a href="http://www.da2g.com" target="_blank">micah</a> and myself, and his 
lending me his truck to get all my shit to this weekend's garage sale.  
<br><br>
no news is good news.
<!-- for real though -->
<br><br>
last note: 
i just updated my page using omniedit.com's web based ftp service, and they 
hooked me up with this groovy little link.  that shit's got to go, no matter 
how cool their customer service department is.
<!-- 
sending me emails when 
they've seen i've had problems using their 
formerly crappy website and all...
