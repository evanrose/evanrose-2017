whew!  much better.

<a href="http://www.edanz.com" target="_blank">edanz.com</a> 
has gotten 100,000 hits in the past two days, it seems as though i was wrong.  we may 
be buying 
a new domain that will strictly be dance music radio, and running this thing might be 
my new gig.  still up in the air at the moment...(i wonder if they'd let me design 
the site? and yes,
i can do better than this one)
this has been a most "social" week, and it continues: coffee with don, daria in town, 
lunch with julie, 
dancing and parties, a new commitment beginning on monday... i'm trying to take an 
active role in the relationships in my life: i've been spending too much time at 
home, along, working with fireworks.  and speaking of which, i'm working with 
fireworks again,
 a new site should be forthcoming, but january 1 seems a bit soon (because of my
 computers crashing nonstop!!).  the black will have to do until then.
