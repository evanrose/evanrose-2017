<a href="000516.html">one year ago today</a> was my first official business 
day in california; what an amazing year, and what an amazing weekend, the party and 
michael's birthday, 
the late night conversations, the roof, the disco room and 
the mirrors, dinner and seeing shelley carol at sambuca and getting 
to see some of the dallas crew and spending some time 
with larkin (who's graduating and leaving in less than a week), 
<a href="http://www.lozenge.net" target="_blank">john</a> and my mom 
were all wonderful 
but too short and at the end the tearing apart was almost too
much - the thought that that might have been the last time such parting will be necessary 

<!-- she's coming on 6/15, then going back only to be back again for good by 7/1 -->

has been a helpful thought, as has mom's blessing 

<!-- she's always more understanding, patient and loving than i expect her to be, 
and i think that she has more faith and trust in me than i give myself credit for -->

and the conversations on the 
promise of possibility as 
the universe continues to give me gifts as if on a silver platter; there are all sorts 
of wonderful things afoot, all sorts of silver linings: 
<a href="http://www.zoza.com" target="_blank">zoza</a>'s closing, mad severance checks 
(goodbye credit card debt)/ 
computer sales and a contracting gig with (the beloved) 
<a href="http://www.smallpondstudios.com" target="_blank">small pond studios</a>, the 
bad neighborhood around the greyhound bus station that would have been almost perfect 
until i got an email (almost out of the blue) from 
<a href="http://www.weirdcarnival.com/" target="_blank">big fun!</a> that appears to be our 
dream place and keeping up with all the various and assundry things, 
school, spinning records, accounting and friends and putting 
out there what i need and want is being paid back to me way more than in kind - and all of this 
working and planning seem to be working, just like i planned.
