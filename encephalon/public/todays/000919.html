getting over sickness that turned into "allergies" (just like a little slice of home!) and 
excessive brainpower expenditure at atg's dynamo for 
<a href="http://java.sun.com" target="_blank">java</a> developers (which i am not - yet) 
has made this little stretch of peace i am enjoying right now between school and bed 
that much more enjoyable - not to say a good time wasn't had by all when 
geoff, <a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">stephen</a>, 
<a href="http://www.peterme.com" target="_blank">peter</a> and i got together for dinner and the 
trans am show on sunday night which was excellent but rather strange as 
i had never noticed how apathetic san francisco audiences were (apparently they're all 
like that) and i felt like the band felt it and was putting off weird vibes but 
after training and school *yesterday*, i rolled down and saw them again (and again being 
opened for by an awesome art rock(!) band that for the life of me can't remember the 
name of - and don't forget about
<a href="http://neilhamburger.tvheaven.com/" target="_blank">neil hamburger</a>) 
and they rocked my lame ass and everyone seemed in much better spirits 
and there's lots to look forward to very soon, 
<a href="http://fray.org/4/" target="_blank">fray day</a>, peter's party, micah's 
*coming in town tomorrow(!) and even more excellence 
that i'll remember later on - good, because i needed a little pick me up after sending 
my little &lt;update&gt; over the weekend - forgot to remove my former roomates' email 
addresses and felt sort of stupid opening up an already smarting wound but hey, 
i've done stupid things and had shit blow up in my face before - its just unfortunate 
that there are times (like this morning when i read my email...) when my picture of 
myself and others' realities totally don't jibe, but as frank once asked me "did you do 
the best you could?" and i of course would reply "well, no, but..." and he would say 
"why didn't you better?" and i would say "because i chose not to; i did what i wanted to 
do" and he would say "so you couldn't do it better at that point in time" and i would 
say "well, yeah, but..." and he would say "so?" and i would reply and hold on to the 
fact that i really did the best i could in and for the situation and that the next time 
i ran into such a situation, it would probably turn out even better.
