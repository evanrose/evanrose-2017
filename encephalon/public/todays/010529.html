i had decided that my life was too overloaded with information; for a long time now 
i've gotten up in the morning and pored over some of the ream of papers worth of 
information i'd printed the day (or in the days) before, reading about some very 
interesting things; history and psychology of the web, business, programming news and theory - 
all sorts of things - while reading one of 3 magazine subscriptions and whatever novel/novels 
and/or non-fiction tomes i was working through - i'd done that for a long time and 
came to realize i a. wasn't *learning* anything (i learn by doing) and b. was merely 
escaping - as the stuff i was reading, though interesting, wasn't benifitting me very 
much at all - and since i've stopped i've plowed through 6 or 8 books (this is in the 
past two weeks, most recently, alan lightman's 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679758771/encephalon-20/104-8751144-7619140" target="_blank">dance for two</a>), 
one of those being douglas coupland's 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060987049/encephalon-20/104-8751144-7619140" target="_blank">microserfs</a> 
which about people who dealt with 
computers and their coming closer to each other and themselves, which is all fine and 
good - i could use some coming closer to myself and others but in the meantime, this extra energy 
feels like its getting wasted in a different way ('cause i really am not doing anything 
differently - in fact not doing much at all) which is perhaps only indication of 
the funk that i'm in/the fear that i'm in - not working so much (on my own stuff nor 
for a living), sorta directionless (as far as school and career are concerned), 
uninspired (which has to do with my art and music and work and friends and all of life 
in general; whoa, is ths the crux of the problem? dunno) not to mention what i've mentioned 
plenty of times before - the short term logistical changes i'm about to go through that 
are not very big deals in themselves, but that are intimately tied to emotion and my 
emotions in particular - sigh - and this weekend i'm going to be doing something that i've 
wanted to do for a long time but have 1. kept failing at and 2. kinda don't want to do too 
much and that i won't even mention... so yeah - at this point, i truly don't 
know and have reached 
a point where i care, but not that much as i'm sure it or this or whatever will change and 
as usual its probably something small and stupid but doesn't feel like it right now but 
come tomorrow night (when she comes into town) this'll all go away (for a li'l bit) and 
i suppose that i'll continue to do the best i can which really is the best that i can 
'cuase if i could do it any better, right now, i sure would.
