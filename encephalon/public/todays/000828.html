i just went halfway through doing this whole update in 
<a href="http://www.geek-girl.com/unix.html" target="_blank">unix</a>, but decided i didn't know 
<a href="http://www2.ncsu.edu/cc/pub/tutorials/pico_tutor/pico_intro.html" target="_blank">pico</a> 
well enough, and also decided that i really like the fact that 
<a href="#" title="go over to http://www.google.com and do a search for 'more evil than the devil himself' and see what you find!">windows</a> lets me 
highlight text and copy text and click control/w to close something, though it does 
feel cool updating one's site on the server side and i think it'd be alot easier 
if i had a one page blog style kinda deal, which i'm working on at the moment with 
<a href="http://www.xml.com" target="_blank">xml</a>, i think - i actually haven't figured out what xml is for, but anyway after 
the blowup last night "you're just another geoff" he said, i called the land lady today 
to find out my options and she was very adament that it was none of here business 
so when i get to speak to the roomies again, i'll pass along the info that its totally 
allowable for them to take over my lease and i'll even let them keep my deposit (!) but 
not clue them into the fact that they can easily say no (yes i know what i'm saying, 
i just want the do the right thing), but the winner of course will be the one that 
agrees to pay the least amount of money, but it won't matter in the slightest as i'd pay 
anything to get out of this place and into my new one and it looks like i've just won and 
it was also nice today not just going to work as i didn't enjoy my weekend very much 
at all, but i spoke to my dear friend <a href="000612.html">daria</a> whom i miss so much and we discussed the 
fact that her family was not coming to montreal for thanksgiving, therefore i get to 
go up for thanksgiving <a href="vacation1199.html">again</a> which is most excellent - 
though i'm going to miss seeing <a href="http://members.theglobe.com/eva119/" target="_blank">larkin</a>  
until next february when she comes out here (sigh) but we're going to make for lost time 
then as well as when i convince her to move on out here, but in the meantime, i'm planning 
on my 3rd favorite spot in north america with one of my favorite people in north america 
and i'm remembering now the feeling i had this spring when everything was just about 
to start coming together because i'm feeling it now and things are starting to come together, 
like i think i've known they would but a little extra faith never hurts anyway...
