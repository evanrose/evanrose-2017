not feeling much like writing, thinking i've not much to say (thinking also that i'm 
sounding vaguely british...) - perhaps thinking too much though thinking on the 
other hand that that's not the case - "images flashing" (and probably too tired 
and movied out to be writing clearly - all sorts of communication this past week - 
connection - perhaps preparation for the next... "peaking" or plateuing perhaps... 
i awoke from a nap and 
<a href="http://www.amontobin.com" target="_blank">amon tobin</a> through headphones 
on monday to find a gift from 
<a href="http://www.eleganthack.com" target="_blank">someone i didn't even know</a> 
echoing and confirming daria's message "... i don't know about random acts of kindness..." 
from just a few days before (when i awoke from another nap to find another book) 
and i was thinking then as i'm thinking now about the amazingness of people - of 
friends i haven't yet met - but the ones i spent thursday with (gates?  huh?  ange?  wha'?) 
and friday night with my 
<a href="http://www.zoza.com" target="_blank">team</a> along with nic and ed at 
<a href="http://www.zoza.com/zine/bios/caseyd.jhtml" target="_blank">casey</a>'s - and 
yeah - and its very close - very very close to being as close as i'd like, though 
a little edge creeping in from a day of sitting in front of the computer making 
progress at a snails pace and feeling thouroughly uninspired and then watching 
<a href="http://www.human-traffic.com/" target="_blank">a film</a> 
that brought back memories of england and 
parties and drugs and friends - heh, i love those raver movies - they remind me 
in need to be shaking my ass... and getting back on the computer and thinking how 
good it is that this is where i am and the now that will be here in 6 days (oh yeah, only 
6 days) time - and i'm thinking that i must have felt like writing anyway (april fools!).
