<p>unfortunately, i was disappointed, but i learned a great deal and 
have remembered that i have lots and lots of work to do and that my 
priorities and what i place importance on (that lots and lots of 
<a href="http://www.inthehead.com" target="_blank">work</a> refered to before) need to be 
first in my mind - this is a work in progress - always a work in progress and 
a learning experience and i also learned that 
my name of evan gives me a clever mind, good business judgment, a 
sense of responsibility, and an appreciation of the finer things of 
life but i am serious-minded and not inclined to make light of things 
even in little ways, and in my younger years i had more mature 
interests than others my age and home and family mean a great deal to me 
and it is natural that i should desire the security of a peaceful, 
settled home environment where i can enjoy the companionship of family 
and friends and whatever i set out to accomplish i do my very best to 
complete in accordance with what i consider to be right and in the home 
i assume my responsibilities capably, having the self-confidence to 
form my own opinions and make my own decisions and others can rely on 
me; once i have given my word i will do my utmost to fulfil a 
responsibility; however, there is a tendency to be a little too 
independent in my thinking and it is difficult for me to accept the 
help of others when i should; due to my strong sense of 
responsibility, i could experience worry and mental turmoil through 
assuming more responsibility than i should and friction could arise 
through others feeling that i was interfering with their rights and 
privileges, even though i am only trying to help and what this means 
is i am being true to myself when i stay home on a friday night to catch up 
on reading and that i really am still doing the right thing, as i'm spending 
a bit too much time thinking that i'm not.</p>
