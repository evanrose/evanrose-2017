beat out after school and work and going out last night to 
<a href="http://bayarea.citysearch.com/E/V/SFOCA/1000/26/01/cs1.html" target="_blank">330 ritch</a> 
with trancestephen for the trance 
where we had a good trancetime and good tranceconversation with 
trance<a href="http://www.epitonic.com/artists/singlecellorchestra.html" target="_blank">miguel</a> and watched 
these fucking idiots do "the liquid" for each other and i wished that cory could have been 
there to see it but aside from all that it was excellent today when tanju (the landlord 
extrordinaire) called me up and told me that i got the place(!) but wondered why my 
credit had been run 10 times in the past year and he (hopefully) understood that that sort 
of thing happens when one moves and gets a phone and tries unsuccessfully to get another 
credit card because he is absolutely broke and speaking of broke i am just about there 
after paying for the car stuff and paying bills (ooh!  deja vu!) and buying 85 dollars 
worth of school books today and i have to go back tomorrow and get another one but i'm 
going to photocopy the one i got today at work tomorrow so it shouldn't be that bad and 
i'm also thinking about my options when i tell the roomies that i'm breaking the lease like 
since i gave a 600$ deposit and i'll be leaving halfway through the month why don't they 
take 300 of that to pay for the first half of the month and keep the rest for my 
inconsiderateness which will have the excellent effect of me not paying rent here in a 
week which a damn near can't afford anyway, but this could be an excellent break as 
things are going to be tight for a minute here, but damn i've got to go out for 
<a href="http://www.snowball.com" target="_blank">greg</a>'s birthday saturday etc. etc. etc. 
but its all good 'cause these blasts from the past keep coming in the form of hearing from 
lindsey and <a href="991227.html">renee</a> on the answering machine and laying back 
and listening to the "summer 94 tape" that i'm planning on playing for evan tomorrow, 
listening to my old crew, leela, stan, kelly, colin, scott, jason, justin, and hearing 
myself smoke pot by myself while i'm being recorded because stan said "y'all forget this 
thing is here" and man i did and it brought back so many memories of those wonderfully 
stupid people and those amazing wasted (literaly and figuratively) times, the year of 
<a href="../writing/beginning.html">nicola</a> 
treatment and leaving home and sleeping on alot of sofas and 
<a href="../stuff/jason.html" target="_blank">jason s.</a> and 
carolyn and lots more that i wish i could remember while i'm wishing that times could be 
like that again and so glad that they aren't.
