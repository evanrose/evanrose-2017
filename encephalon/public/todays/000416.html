i was supposed to spin a party last night (for the same guy i spun 
for <a href="000227.html">
last time</a>) but went to bed at 
8pm and except for waking up during a  horrible downpour to roll 
my windows up, slept till 10 this morning.  
<br><br>
oops.
<br><br>

<!-- i did feel bad, blowing him off and all, it had to be done.  again. -->

cory and i had breakfast and discussed his moving out to l.a. at the 
end of this month, 

<!-- everyone appears to think we're moving together.  maybe they're right -->

and speaking of l.a., i just saw 
<a href="http://www.nbc.com/passions/bios/pgv_passions_bios_mountz.html" target="_blank">
taylor anne</a>, looking fine as ever, at the coffee haus.  
<br>
<br>
right this second, i'm feeling very excited and hopeful:  i went back to 
make a sandwich and heard the guy on the radio telling me exactly 
what i needed to hear,   

<!-- 
"... and its a beautiful day today, not a cloud in the sky, 80 degrees, 
just like it is in san francisco right now, except for the hills, the 
culture, the beauty, and the $5000 rent for a studio apartment."  
<br>
now why did he say this, during the only 2 minutes i've listened to the 
radio in months?
<br>
<br>
-->

and man that is so fucking cool.
