jason and i spent the weekend enjoying ourselves:  eating, talking, sitting in the sun, 
walking the haight, hanging out with tom (who came in from l.a.), calling the cops after 
hearing scary noises, going to an incredible meeting down in the castro, making big plans and dreaming big dreams...
i even found 
<a href="http://urban.netbeat.com/products/ambient_1_16245.html" target="_blank">music for airports</a>, 
which had spent two years at the top of my want list.
<br>
<br>
oh yeah, and i got convinced.
<br>
<br>
so now that's what's on my mind; that and laughing hysterically as i rode the swings on 
the hill in buena vista park because i had never felt better or been more excited in my life.

link: <a href="http://www.theapt.com" target="_blank">the apartment</a>'s 
flash floorplan thingy is something that would have been a dream come true in my wanting to 
be an architect days when i was between 5 and 15, and their beautiful website is something 
for me to be all about now.
