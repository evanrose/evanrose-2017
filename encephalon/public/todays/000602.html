its amazing how difficult some seemingly simple things should be.  
for instance, i've been trying to get to the bank for days, but even 
before that i tried to get to my p.o. box to get the check that 
needed to go to the bank for days.  i finally found a fax machine, 
6 days after i started looking.  now, these aren't life or death 
things, but they certainly require more consideration than they used to.

<br>
<br>

in the intirim, i seem to have settled into a really 
nice rythm of late, the drive to work (and the "money shot" 
that takes my breath away, every day), parking in soma and a 20 
minute walk to my office (which is 
much better than paying $30 for 8 hours of parking like i did the 
other day), taking a new and different route there and back, the 
drive back home but stopping for coffee and reading the paper while 
the traffic thins out; its so sweet.  even sweeter than that is the 
fact that when i'm not traveling, i'm on the clock.  not so good 
for my social life, but, well, my social life has always been 
too much trouble...

<br>
<br>
i just got off the phone with daria, and we're firming up her plans 
for coming out next thursday.  i can't wait to see her, but in the 
meantime, baby need a new pair of shoes!

i wish i could say something was going on that required this
