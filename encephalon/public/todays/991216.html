2 weeks left 'til the year 2000.  i remember being little and 
thinking how old i was going to be 
and how far i had to go until the year 2000.  i still feel like 
i have a long way to go.
</p>
<p>
i'm pretty upset right now; my laptop is broken.  its not even paid for yet.  
thankfully i spend my life surrounded by 
computers, so work will be a little slower coming- not stopped.
</p>
<p>
i've been thinking of things that i'd like to start (and stop) doing 
soon (like in 2 weeks maybe? new year's resolutions?), school, 
building furniture, electronic music,
</p>
<p>
bigger, better, faster, more...
