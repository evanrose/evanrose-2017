on saturday 
mom and billy and i had a whole day of driving to carmel, driving around, driving back, and 
boy is my ass tired.  the coolest part was the incredible fog all the way up the coast on 
highway one.  at times it reminded me of my time in san antonio, at others the scene 
was remeniscent of the moors of england.  god its beautiful here.  got home super late 
and heard from my girls lindsey and daria.  also heard from <a href="000103.html">don</a> who's going 
to be in town on the 13th of next month.
<br>
<br>
i also got a chance to do alot of thinking about where i want to live, as i'm sure that 
i want to be here for a while (interesting in and of itself!).  i've been thinking about 
mill valley since before i got here, and it'd be totally worthwhile to pay double what 
i'm paying now because i'd be super close to work and 
<a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">a friend</a> as well as the depot 
cafe and bookstore.  berkeley has been on my mind recently too, but that option 
needs to be explored 
more fully later on.
<br>
<br>
after breakfast, shopping at banana republic (for 3 pairs of trousers - on sale), napping, and 
dinner at pasta pomordoro yesterday, i got mom back to dallas this am, then after work 
maxed and relaxed 
in mill valley on into the early evening.  now i'm back to writing code without any 
distractions, except for a call 
at 10 pm from susan at <a href="http://www.atg.com" target="_blank">atg</a> who's on vacation.  
not only was i flummoxed by her customer service skills, but i also got an invite to the 
dynamo 5 launch party which is the same night as the electronic music portion of the 
<a href="http://www.nbjazzfest.org/forward.html" target="_blank">north beach jazz festival</a> my 
crew and i are attending.  
i'm thinking a tight schedule might be ok).
<br>
<br>
life, i'm finding is almost a bore; i dig that.
