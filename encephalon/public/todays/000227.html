its 4.30 in the morning, and i just got finish spinning at the lamest 
party i've ever seen, lamer than i even imagined was possible.  cory 
offered me $300 not to go; i should have taken him up on it!
<br><br>
work work work.  interview with 
<a href="http://www.insite.net" target="_blank">insite</a> 
went well (i think - we'll find out 
on march 9), and i'm hoping my thank you note makes it go even better! 
monday, a meeting with cain over lunch, then an afternoon meeting with 
swerve records.
<br><br>
i'm so glad my bills are getting paid.
<br><br>
mom has become the new co-director of the dallas branch of 
<a href="http://www.cashforbirthcontrol.com" target="_blank">
CRACK, children requiring a caring kommunity</a>, probably the most 
democratic and forward thinking (not to mention potentially 
controversial!) non-profit organization ever.  they pay female drug 
addicts $200 to get their tubes tied. they pay males too.
