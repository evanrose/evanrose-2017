things are happening, yes indeed, everywhere i look.
<br>
<br>
work: we're getting our own personal nt servers (running on powerbooks) tomorrow at the 
<a href="http://www.gapinc.com" target="_blank">9-5</a> - kinda cool after 
finding a manual on just that subject in the parking lot on my way home last week, and andrew 
(the super boss man) and i are going to combine his mad scripting skills with my 
<a href="http://www.alldanzradio.com" target="_blank">internet radio 
experience</a> to possible save them lots and lots (and lots) of money - which'll hopefully 
come back to us in some form or another.  i also spoke with jason and john about 

<!-- 
and we are all going to be filthy stinking rich because of --> the idea, <!-- i even 
had a thought about buying my mother a big old blue rolls royce like i used to talk about 
doing when i got "rich and famous" (c. 1983).  that would probably make me the happiest 
kid alive.  an active imagination is the best cure for boredom.
-->
 
and will be speaking to them together tonight - very very exciting stuff.  haven't heard 
back from <a href="000618.html">zoza</a> yet though...
<br>
<br>
play: as far as play goes, there hasn't been much of it (at least in the past three days), 
but i did take the ferry to work today for the first time, 
and will likely do that again soon.  i got to spend 
45 minutes reading 
<a href="http://www.wallpaper-online.com" target="_blank">wallpaper</a> on the 
way in, and an 45 minutes looking at the bay on the way back in.  i liked that alot.
<br>
<br>
mom's coming into town tomorrow evening (shit!  i gotta drive to the city again!), and 
we are going to have a wonderful weekend.
