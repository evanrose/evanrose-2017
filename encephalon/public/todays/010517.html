crazy tuesday night and more was added to the "to be assessed" pile that 
already includes new thinking and attitude involving my other and our 
upcoming plans that are very close to being (or have already been?) set 
in stone - plans that larkin and i had a long talk about last night 
and perhaps that situation requires no assessment - just waiting 
and fantasizing, but work needs to be assessed, what with the closing 
of <a href="http://www.zoza.com" target="_blank">the company</a> and 
the checks that came and that are coming in as well as my joining 
<a href="http://www.smallpondstudios.com" target="_blank">small pond</a> 
on the <a href="http://www.leapfrog.com" target="_blank">leapfrog</a> 
project which has all worked out wonderfully financially and will 
be much better, not only for my career, but for that one non-existant 
word that means "love for ones work" and actually come to think of it, 
work doesn't need any assessment; it ended, its sad, some of them sucked 
and some are friends for life, maybe i'll get an extra check or two, 
maybe i won't, and unlike so many, i've already got another job - 
and a whole lot more of a job too - nope, that's all good, so perhaps 
tuesday and drama and big dreams and big plans and my part in them 
(the key there, oh yeah) has come into clearer focus - which also 
requires very little thought, and much like i mentioned about 
<a href="010419.html">being on a certain road</a>, that is indeed and still the 
case - but roads converge just as they diverge and perhaps we're all 
on the same road and even in the same car - so maybe because its such a 
long trip and i've seen so much and have navigated and even driven some 
of the way - perhaps i need to do what i was doing in the first place 
that allowed for all of this which is crawling back in the back and 
looking up through the window at the power lines that bob up and 
down as we roll along.
