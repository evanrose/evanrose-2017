<p>monday before last (damn it seems so long ago now), she called, and we talked, 
then tuesday got exempted from the astronomy final and wednesday i studied and picked up 
<a href="http://www.ruthie-media.com" target="_blank">jen</a> at the airport really really late 
then on thursday i forgot my homework and took the biolab final (and got an a in the class, 
thankyouverymuch) then studied more then friday took the biology final and fixed my headlights 
(like a real man) and worked 'til nine, then dinner with steve and trish and jen at the 
cantina and ended up at 
<a href="http://www.sfstation.com/clubs/26mix.htm" target="_blank">shawn's</a> party in the mission, so 
then on saturday got up early and hauled ass to the airport and got on a plane and met 
larkin outside on my way for a smoke in and we went for a drink/coffee and she dropped 
me off and mom and i had dinner then met up with her and 
<a href="http://www.lozenge.net" target="_blank">john</a> and we ended up at the expo lounge 
(<a href="000511.html">from whence i came</a>) and on sunday i called cory and tried to 
surprise him but he (just) knew i was in town so we met for breakfast at john's cafe and 
had shots with candice at terilli's and rolled to northpark just like old times and met 
mom and amanda at good eats and <a href="http://www.drowse.8m.com" target="_blank">matt</a> 
and john showed up(!) as a little surprise for me(!) and we rolled out and went to "the loft" 
where wesley/micheal, charly p., james p. and others are living and even more are kicking 
it so somehow matt and i ended up talking until really late about our respective paths and 
our respective rock stardom (or lack thereof) and instead of crashing at my mom's place for 
lack of a key that would end up causing mad problems, i crashed at matt's after watching 
die hard and woke up from dreams of plane crashes within dreams of sleeping in a dark room 
and thank god for vacation and there's no place like home.</p>
