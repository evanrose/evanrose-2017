had a wonderful lunch with 
<a href="http://www.edanz.com" target="_blank">john and marli</a> 
 (who's moving to atlanta in 
a month - she will be missed) and finally i got copies of my missing 
midi files.  in other news, i finished the 
<a href="http://www.inthehead.com" target="_blank">ith site</a> 
also (no html editors used or abused in the making of this site).
<br><br>
yesterday i was discussing with cory at starbuck's on knox/henderson 
the fact that i have a book called 
<a href="http://members.soltec.net/~java/pastbook5.htm" target="_blank">let's make mary</a> that 
<a href="../writing/you.html">danette</a> had ripped 3 
pages out of almost 
3 years ago, and that i had found a copy of the book at the estate 
sale i worked over the weekend.  i've wondered for 3 years what was 
on those pages.  as i was telling him the story i 
looked across the parking lot and there she was, looking at me.    
nine months ago, at the same place, she rode by on a bicycle when i 
was talking about her.  

<!--
whenever i see her, i want to find out how she is, what she's doing, 
what's been going on;  i don't though, it was just too fucking painful.

i still miss her sometimes.

<br><br>
speak of the devil and she shall appear.

and i'm not fucking kidding.
