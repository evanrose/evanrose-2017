she replied, and it was very nice.

<!-- 
i think its amazing that i will always think about her like i do now, always wonder 
about the possibilities, and always want to see her again.  always.

i finally pried myself from the 
<a href="../contact/index.html" target="_blank">cgi-bin</a> last night 
to roll down to the bottom of the hill to see 
<a href="http://www.xsite.com/~dianogah/" target="_blank">dianogah</a> (a 
favorite of 
<a href="http://www.inthehead.com/product/web/sites/drowserawk/" target="_blank">matt</a>'s 
and mine), the champs (who i saw open up for <a href="../writing/transam.html">trans am</a> last year), 
and don cabillero (who i'd never heard of before).  a trio of trios, all instrumentalists, excellent 
show.  only 8 bucks too.
<br>
<br>
today i did the fourth of july thing.  the parade this morning, fireworks with stephen and trish 
(and trish's folks) in sauselito, worked on 
<a href="http://www.inthehead.com" target="_blank">in the head</a> in between, and 
now i'm contemplating going in late tomorrow 'cause i've had to good a time the past four days.  or 
maybe just 'cause i can.
<br>
<br>
i thanked stephen for inviting me to come out with them tonight and he told me i hadn't been invited, 
but that i was family and it was "an obligation", then he asked to borrow a hundred dollars.
<br>
<br>
what are friends for (when you've got family)?

<a href="http://www.madxs.com" target="_blank">mad x s</a>, where stephen is 
working for (and i will soon be "helping")  
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/web/gallery/mad/main.html" target="_blank">these people</a> 
who did the artwork for 
<a href="http://www.gingkopress.com/_cata/_arch/arcmubu1.htm" target="_blank">this book</a> 
which is excellent.
