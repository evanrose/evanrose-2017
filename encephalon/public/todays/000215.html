i wrote checks today to the southwestern bell , to chase auto finance, 
to eastern plaza apartments, and to the credit card company.  
i'm out of debt. tomorrow 
i'm getting a bike, and expecting emails about jobs.  i'm also going 
to school.  i might call a girl.    
<br><br>
i went to a swanky party in a swanky loft in some swanky clothes.  i 
met some swanky people.  i handed out several cards and talked about 
some interesting things.
<br><br>
one of my paintings and some dried flowers were destroyed.  a young 
lady spent the night.  i've quit smoking.  i'm thinking of selling 
my car.  i'm looking foreward to daria coming into town. 
i'm still excited.  i'm 
not making any decisions.  i haven't set my alarm clock in 6 days.  
i'm drinking coffee at home.  
<br><br>
i'm telling no lies.  i have no plans or expectations.  
<br><br>
i'm firmly convinced that none of this matters in the slightest.  i'm 
really happy.
