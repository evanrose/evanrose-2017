got mom back to dallas late last night after a full day of bead 
shopping (her newest thang) and checking out the scene in mill valley 
and berkeley.  i bought a ton of books, found a ton of cool furniture, 
and got a great 50's metal kitchen container thing for my birthday.  
<br>
<br>
enjoyed the hell out of hanging with moms.
<br>
<br>
today has been spent in front of the computer in various states.  in reverse 
chronological order, tonight has been about getting a (cracked) copy of 
allaire homesite that'll allow me to insert server-side-includes (via the 
extended replace function - a godsend!), while 
reading "cgi programming in c & perl".  talking to 
<a href="vacation1199.html#luc">luc</a> via i.m. was nice too.
<br>
<br>
this afternoon was about writing actual letters (i was sitting near the computer) 
to larkin and daria who are in <a href="000621.html">europe</a>, and to john s. 
who'd asked me to write him around the first (of last month...).  i hadn't 
written a letter in a long time, and i got to thinking about how slowly 
i write compared to how quickly i think, which makes the letter writing process 
feel so complete - i can get everthing said in my own time.  when writing emails 
and typing much faster than i can think, 
the message feels so abruptly conversational and extremely onesided.  the same 
goes for i.m. conversations, however <a href="000604.html">personable they 
might be</a>...
<br>
<br>
the kicker came early in the game today, when i got up almost first thing 
and found an email from <a href="../writing/nonfiction.html">nicola</a> in 
my inbox.  needless to say i was thrown for a loop especially after what 
was said <a href="../writing/weekend.html">last fall</a>, not to mention 
everything before.  sigh.  
<br>
<br>
i can't help thinking about her reading this, and i can't help but wonder if 
i'm going to spend my next two days in front of this computer (in various states) 
waiting for her to reply.
