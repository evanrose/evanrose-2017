<!-- begin entry -->

it seems as though every third or fourth entry i write gets messed up somehow and i 
end up rewriting it, sometimes i pull the plug out of the wall, sometimes i go 
looking for something and my computer crashes, its always something and then i get to 
thinking about what i've just written about then i forget some stuff and remember 
some other stuff and somehow or another it gets (re)written but it wouldn't matter 
that much this weekend as it has been extremely uneventful except for hanging out 
with evan on friday night in san jose catching up and reaquainting each other as he 
got wasted in my car (seeing his folks was wonderful too: and its crazy to think 
how different my life would be had i never met him as he was a catalyst for so much, up to 
and including my trip to barbados in '93) and a crazy ass party in a 5 story 
<a href="http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/ggescher/ggescher-53972.0.html" target="_blank">mc escher</a>esque 
maze of a house where there was a band and 10 djs and absolutely crammed full of people, 
unfortunately parties don't do much for me except give me an opportunity to watch people 
walk by but we ate before hand and it was a pretty chill night except for our driving around 
in circles for more than an hour in two different parts of the city trying to find a parking 
place which was absolutely maddening especially when i'm not driving, but in the meantime i 
spoke to larkin on the phone and got my xml and flash and homework on and even took care of 
a bit of 
<a href="http://www.inthehead.com/product/web/sites/laureladvisors/index.html" target="_blank">client work</a> 
(and wouldn't <a href="http://www.useit.com" target="_blank">jakob</a> be proud?) which is 
ultra cool and will be even cooler when i get a check so its back to piddling around and 
trying to get some shit done over here.

be in town in less than a month!)'s "you can always get what you want", a collection of 
live stuff and b-sides that i'm finding i like a lot better than their newest lp, "red line" 
which i got a little early.
