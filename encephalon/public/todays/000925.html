i almost couldn't bring myself to write this as the dichotomy of keeping a record of 
my thoughts and actions out in the world (wide web) and my taste for the records of others 
versus the 
meat-space (as stephen so gingerly put it) and our interactions there hit me like a ton of 
bricks at <a href="http://www.fray.org/4/" target="_blank">fray</a> on friday and then again 
at <a href="http://www.peterme.com" target="_blank">peter</a>'s 
<a href="../stuff/milan.html">cocktail</a> party on saturday - how incredibly 
odd to be in a room full of people who i know; i know 
<a href="http://www.camworld.com" target="_blank">their</a> work, i know 
<a href="http://www.kottke.org" target="_blank">their</a> interests and 
beliefs, i know some of 
<a href="#" title="&lt;!-- its almost funny --&gt;">their dirty secrets</a>, and yet 
we have never met and however exciting 
this was to me, both the getting to know their online representation of themselves and the 
possibility of getting to know them in more of a human way (because its people who matter...), 
i realized that i am a fish out of water and tradional 
social rules still applied no matter how "new media" and have only begun to 
analyze and understand the meaning of and behind all of this and once 
again i question my desire to take part in this collective performance art piece 
(though i can't help but get giggle at the stupidness and arte noir quality of it all) 
and i suppose that this is (one of my) art(s) and i'll stage it and play it and paint it 
for all its worth and be glad that so much less bad has come of it than good.
