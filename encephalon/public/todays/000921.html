micah is out here now, and he's currently being convinced that this is where he needs to 
be, but when i saw 
<a href="http://www.affairoflove.com/" target="_blank">an affair of love</a> 
last night, i was in paris with them 
as i was that <a href="../writing/nonfiction.html">november, three years ago</a> 
- at the end of my rope knowing what was 
wrong and knowing how to make it right but that time came and went and everything was 
left unsaid (because since the beginning of the end - i'd never said it) but just 
yesterday - i spoke to her and then saw a film that put it so perfectly and 
remembered that i was supposed to follow my heart no matter what - because i never 
have and don't know if i'm really able to because i didn't do or say what i was 
supposed to - i came home and went to work and i'm still working because now that's the 
only thing i have and the only thing i really know how to do - and i do it well and my 
wanting to scream at the movie screen hasn't turned inward and i just knew that 
today i would forget *that* feeling while still remembering that i'll get another 
chance before too long and maybe then i'll be ready to take it because 
"it was an act of love, and that's all that mattered".
