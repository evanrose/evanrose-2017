drastic measures are being called for at the moment ('cause of those darn drastic times) 
but i can't help feeling super good and even more excited about the way that things 
seem to be progressing as verdicts (and a whole bunch of cash?) are being delivered 
tomorrow regarding <a href="http://www.zoza.com" target="_blank">zoza</a> 

<!-- my whole team is getting laid off - except for me.  we're going to be 
involved in some sort of transition... there's some serious 
<a href="http://www.fuckedcompany.com" target="_blank">fucked company</a> shit 
going on... -->

and i'm still 
spending alot of time on the phone with alot of people regarding working, living and 
various and assundry combinations of the two - and not only is there no stress (for once), 
my creative juices are flowing in an i must say devinely inspired way - i'd been thinking 
of doing things differently recently (stopping smoking in my house, 

<!-- which is all about anje (thank you), who's staying here at the mo' -->

going down to ultra 
lights, cutting out sugar - again, cutting out red meat and pork - slowly but surely, 
arrangements for creative working and living arrangements, and more...) and am continuing 
to do so - perhaps just by being a bit more proactive than usual and being 
honest about and relentlessly going after exactly what i want - yeah its really good and 
things are still looking up as i take the day off (per 
<a href="http://www.zoza.com/zine/bios/caseyd.jhtml" target="_blank">casey</a>'s 
recommendation) to maintain (haircut, a 
<a href="http://www.insideout.co.uk/films/a/amores_perros.shtml" target="_blank">movie</a>, 
grocery shopping, paying bills), prepare (planning, oakland, the telephone, dreaming big) 
and to not look forward to the impersonal and non-existent day when "everything will be fine" 
but to enjoy the now that is completely real and all mine.
