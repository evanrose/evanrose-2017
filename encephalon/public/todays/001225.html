<p>what with a mornings at the coffee haus with todd, micah and don p., eating with cory and 
whomever else, buying records, a day with lindsey and daria at the deli and the mall, 
a long and wonderful evening with renee, a great day out with 
<a href="http://www.urbanhome.com" target="_blank">daddy</a> and chloe, seeing 
<a href="http://www.bellaunion.com/lift.htm" target="_blank">lift to experience</a> and 
<a href="http://www.dallasmusic.com/072400/hifi072400.html" target="_blank" title="what's up, carlos!">hi-fi drowning</a> 
with matt'n 'em, shopping and enjoying 
silence with larkin before her departure, seeing james porter play at the coffee shop, 
dinner and kicking it with carolyn s., an 
afternoon rocking out at the loft, seeing all kinds of old friends and making new ones, then 
christmas eve and christmas day with my mom and the fam and friends at the worthington and 
the graff's, its been an amazingly fun week, a week that would make anyone in their right mind 
bail out of the excellent situation they're in in another state and cruise back to texas 
and then i remember how shitty it was when i left and how none of these people really lives 
here anymore and that alot of this closeness i'm feeling with all these people is based 
merely on the fact that we got along well at one point and that we hadn't seen each other 
in a while and i don't know what to make of the feeling i had yesterday on christmas eve 

<!-- even after waking up for more of that sweet lovin' with renee in denton -->

of being so seperated from alot of people that i was once very close to and that there was 
no one in california to take their places but after spending all day with mom in fort worth 
at the worthington and at the graf's for dinner and festivity and family/togetherness 
that was absolutely wonderful and checking my messages to find calls from christmas 
well-wishers and friends (and don't forget daria and i almost giving each other the same 
<a href="http://www.richardmeier.com/" target="_blank">richard meyer</a> 
book) and i find myself looking forward to another week of this 
to enjoy while it lasts and then getting back to my (relatively) new home to make 
the best of my (really and truly excellent) situation.</p>
