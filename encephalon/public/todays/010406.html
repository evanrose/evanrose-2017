aw yeah, getting my visit on today - travelling though, is such a pain as its catch a 
ride with beverly (who's running half an hour late) to work, surfing and printing 
and arranging for the morning (went in and designed and built and tested all our 
newsletters last night), 
then walking over to catch the 
<a href="http://www.marinairporter.com" target="_blank">airporter</a> 
to get me down to sfo only to wait and hope i'm able 
to get on a plane - then its back and forth to smoke and check and smoke and check and 
trying to get reception for my mobile to push back my pick up time when i miss a flight 
(repeat ad infinitum) - then when finally getting on the plane my fear of flying that 
concerns me for days before a trip turns into sheer terror as the plane cruises down the 
runway to take off - then a minute or so of heart pounding white knuckled panic with 
my stomach dropping out whenever there's a bump in the air until we get to cruising 
altitude and then oh my god please let me sleep - the ride is fine and take off is fine and 
i look fine to all the other passengers - i just hate take off, then to get to dfw and 
get to the gate and get my bags and get a smoke and get my trip started will all be 
very cool, she and charly will be at the gate and (should i come in when i hope to come in) mom'll 
get visited and the coffee haus will too - then that quiet time inside a bubble that 
holds out the world and the enjoyment of good friends and good conversation and good times 
will be mine for what will initially seem like forever - and will continue to seem that 
way for almost the entire time - time will move at an appropriate speed, not too fast and 
not too slow and everything will miraculously get done and everyone will get seen and 
we'll eat good and talk and laugh and as usual, all the trouble is worth it.
