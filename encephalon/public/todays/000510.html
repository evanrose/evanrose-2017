well omniupdates <a href="000508.html">
antics</a>, what with destroying my code n' all, have made me furious.  i can't wait to see them 
fail.
<br>
<br>
after jason s. picked me up at the airport tonight, we talked about 
forgotten memories of ours, shared and otherwise, and discussed liars 
in all shapes and sizes

<!-- referring to cory, and his not being in my life any longer - 
if only because of geography -->
 
and i rehashed my trip; a trip that ended up including:

<br>
a.  my getting the place after all, and its in navado (navato?) and 
not in san mateo (which is good.  s.m. is way south, whereas navado 
is north of mill valley and the city).
<br>
b.  99% sure i got a job with 
<a href="http://www.aquent.com" target="_blank">
aquent.com</a> which will straighten me out moneywise rather 
quickly (all they have to do is check references).

<!-- how about 65 to 75 k a year? -->

<br>
c. got a p.o. box in mill valley, right near undertheradar's new 
office space

<!-- more will be revealed... -->

<br>
d. did a lot of talking, laughing, eating, planning, and dreaming; 
i've found san francisco is very condusive to that sort of thing. 
<br>
<br>
not only that, looking back over the past six or seven weeks has made 
me realize that not only has this been one of the best decisions 
i've ever made, the actual decision and subsequent action has also 
made it one of the easiest.
