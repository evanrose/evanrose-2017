i had a slip.  i'm back to more than 24 hours.  damn its hard.
<br><br>
i've figured out that there's a percentage scale involved: i've got to 
want to stop 1% more than i want to keep going.  the moment i want to 
keep going even just 1% more than i want to stop- i smoke.  damn its 
hard.
<br><br>
i'm thinking of getting a bmx bike.  how cool would that be?  i have 
a fantastic image of myself going all over town on my little bmx bike, 
all san francisco'ed out...
<br><br>
that brings a smile to my face.
