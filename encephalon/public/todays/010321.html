<p>
the drama subsides; geoff moved to dallas, 
<a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">stephen</a> still has a job, 
i still have a <a href="http://www.zoza.com" target="_blank">job</a>, so now laying 
back digging some very sweet emails, looking forward to a (getting my) visit (on), and 
after spinning records with stephen at 
<a href="http://bayarea.citysearch.com/profile?fid=5&id=917763" target="_blank">fuse</a> 
on monday night and being offered a residency 
there on tuesday nights (starting tuesday after next, feel free to stop by), excited about getting 
into the late night scene out here, especially after playing with no monitor and mad 
volume problems and kicking ass and this i suppose is one of those quiet between storms 
that is always inevitable and being the crisis junkie i am thinking that the hard times 
are going to stay that way forever seems so stupid at this point in time though i know 
its just a matter of time before i'm up in a tizzy about something but thankfully now 
is one of those times to write checks and catch up and do some laundry and read, even though 
i can't bring myself to get my 
php on or get 
any <a href="http://www.inthehead.com/" target="_blank">work</a> done in general, 
i'm sleeping good and eating good and my place is clean and my laundry's done and my bills 
are paid and hell yeah its all good.
