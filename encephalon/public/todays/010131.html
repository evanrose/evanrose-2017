<p>how wonderful it was one month ago tonight, dinner before with daria at sushi nights  
and then the hidden noise collective party with  matt and hilary and 
micheal and charlie and everyone else who was there
(ooh, and kris and dee) and all sorts of kisses 
at midnighta and dancing to salsa at sambuca but now i've had a 
rather melodramatic week of 1. putting personal things that need to get done that 
fill me with guilt that i'd rather not (ever) get into here off and feeling 
like a "typical man" and a bad one at that, and 2. feeling a 
bit of a flake for deciding to drop 
<a href="http://www.marin.cc.ca.us/~lansing/math/Statistics_ontheNet" target="_blank">statistics</a> 
though we all know math isn't my strong suit and 
an online class made me feel kinda stupid (besides, i couldn't afford another $700 class), 
and 3. speaking of online and stupid, 
table and javaScript hell at work has left me feeling useless and overpaid and 
again, kinda stupid... but my attitudes been good, i haven't lost any sleep, and if i keep 
showing up, its 
all gonna work out fine, and after contemplating 1. being true to myself and trying not to be 
who i've been before which is not only reassuring me now, but is shedding light on 
previous biases against 
<a href="../writing/thatgirl.html">past experiences</a> and 2. concentrating on the 
big picture and arranging a meeting with berkeley to find out what i'm really gonna 
do and thinking about and doing personal work (like working at the depot bookstore or 
a cabinet maker(?) and getting my cgi on, both reading and 
<a href="http://www.flow-sf.com" target="_blank">freelance</a>) before i kill myself with 
a huge school load and 3. just keeping at it because work is work and if it was fun, 
they wouldn't call it work and life at the moment is kinda like that too; my attitudes 
been good, i haven't lost any sleep, and if i keep showing up, its all gonna work out fine.
