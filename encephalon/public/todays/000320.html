i came to realize that the "whassup!" i was hearing in bars and from my 
mother (etc.) is because of a tv commercial.  out of the loop once 
again.

<br>

my status reports shows that i get click-throughs from very 
interesting places, namely and most recently the 
<a href="http://www.webbyawards.com" target="_blank">webby awards site</a>. 
i didn't get nominated, but thank you to whoever submitted me.  much 
better than the referal that <a href="http://www.inthehead.com" target="_blank">
in the head dot com</a> got from inthebutt.com!
<br>

also got one from <a href="http://www.digitalweb.com">digital web dot 
com</a>.  i went and looked, but didn't see myself.  i kinda wish 
i would.

i woke up this morning with a fresh attitude, actually looking forward 
to the week ahead, thinking of things sitting stagnant on my "to do 
list".  i thought about the fact that nothing matters except for how i 
use my time and what i make of myself.

amazing conversation with jason s. on saturday, about who we are and 
how we perceive ourselves and others to be... he cleared up my dualistic 
thinking problem: "our spiritual side (god centered) and our flesh 
side (self centered) are always at warfare.  each one *wants*.  

...but how to align the two...
-->

i thought about the next five 
years of my life: about how far i'd go and the person i'd be at the 
end;  and why not? the 
<a href="000318.html">
last five</a> have been nothing short of amazing.

rebecca cut me off on the phone last night, as i was getting a bit too 
wordy.  weird when i think of us enjoying the big lebowski with matt 
(while matt was in the loo!)

speaking of "aligning the two"...
