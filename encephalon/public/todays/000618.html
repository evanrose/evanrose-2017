friday was probably one of the greatest days i've ever had, and i know 
by the time i laid my head down early saturday morning, i was in one 
the best moods i've ever been in.  another (early morning) interview with 
<a href="http://www.zoza.com" target="_blank">zoza.com</a>, 

<!-- 
i forgot about casey's reaction when i told him i was the one 
who built havenco.com, but i'm sure i won't forget again...
-->

a groovy day at work, light traffic, met geoff for coffee and then...
<br>
<br>
saw the wired magazine with <a href="http://www.sealandgov.com" target="_blank">sealand</a> 
and 
<a href="http://www.havenco.com/" target="_blank">havenco</a> 
on the cover.  oh my god.  what a feeling; like being famous for a second.
<br>
<br>
so i went out that night and shook my ass.  then last night i saw 
steve reich perform 
<a href="http://www.ecmrecords.com/ecm/recordings/1129.html" target="_blank">music for 18 musicians</a>.  
then today jason b. called and told me that he was flying out next 
weekend to try to sell me on an idea he's had (part of the selling 
would be his trying to make me go <a href="000511.html">back</a>.)
<br>
<br>
this is all very very cool.  i could get used to all of this.  
note to self: don't forget where i came from, that 
<a href="../stuff/jason.html" target="top">not everyone is doing as well</a> as i am.
