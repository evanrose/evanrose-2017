i am afraid.
<br>
<br>
i am afraid of one, two, or all of three things: that i'm going 
to lose something i had, that i'm not going to get something i 
want, or that i'm not going to get something i need.
<br>
<br>
it makes me wonder though; what is it that i want?  and when is it 
that want crosses over into need?
i don't think any of it matters because what i'm losing, 
i never really had in the first place.
<br>
<br>
it's amazing how bad nothing hurts.
