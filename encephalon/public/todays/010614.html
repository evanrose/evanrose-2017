<p>
getting kinda bored with this, but... 
worked all weekend with <a href="http://www.wierdcarnival.com" target="_blank">brian</a> out in 
oakland on our new place, well, hung out alot and then moved some shit, also had breakfast 
and catch up with <a href="http://www.peterme.com" target="_blank">peter</a> then bought 
a laptop, computer speaker system and monitor, spun records for the 
<a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">utr crew</a> and former zoza crew,  - been spending 
alot of time with development and ideas - a <a href="http://evanrose.com" target="_blank">new site</a> with 
a <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/" target="_blank">new design(!)</a>, decorating and 
"behavioral architechture" (the zippered x/y coordinated walls...) and shit, what else(?) - hanging 
out, this n' that, writing larkin and speaking to daria (and making plans for a trip for her to visit), 
and gearing up for our next party with <a href="http://www.warprecords.com" target="_blank">richard devine</a> 
and <a href="http://www.schematic.net/" target="_blank">sutehk</a> which has turned out to be very interesting what with 
the <a href="http://www.elmconceptions.com/" target="_blank">la people</a>... the 
correspondence project too... heh - bored 
and waiting and waiting some more - but not for much longer (sunday night is the plan for now and then, who 
knows?) and fuckin' hell: i haven't had a smoke in 4 days.
