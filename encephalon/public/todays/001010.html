<p>the saga continues in the form of <a href="000327.html">email conversations</a> 
progressing as i ditch school because i just had to get some extra sleep and some 
extra studying (which makes tons of sense, really) because i didn't get to 
get my nap on this weekend as it was so busy and so enjoyable, first seeing 
earl and the the <a href="000518.html">again</a> as well as meeting a bunch of excellent people and 
hanging out backstage and <a href="000221.html">feeling cool</a> then jason and i hooked 
up and threw the football and talked shit and ate at 
<a href="http://www.houstons.com/html/home.htm" target="_blank">houston's</a> (oh the 
"houston's hawaiian", oh man) before shooting pool at the 2am club (and enjoying some 
highly entertaining people watching), then 
sunday i got him back to the airport and in the evening i cooked (pasta and 
salad with my special sauce&reg;) and had 
stephen and trish over for a little dinner party before scooting out and catching 
<a href="http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/Century_Of_Films/Story/0,4135,44103,00.html" target="_blank">8&frac12;</a> 
which always diserves another inspection (because we're all in there, and each of us 
is always the star) and fast forward back to this evening as i bask in the glow 
of good telephone conversation and planning for mom's visit day after tomorrow, as 
well as more complicated and interesting plans both oneline and off.</p>
