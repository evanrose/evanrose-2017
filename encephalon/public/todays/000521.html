at the moment, my situation is much like a holding pattern: not working, much,
making just enough money, lonely, but in a houseful of cool people, etc.  i didn't 
come here to do this, and keeping a level head and a good attitude in the face of 
boredom and frustration (not to mention an inferiority complex) is somewhat taxing, 
even though i've only been here a week.  sigh.  there is so much i want to do, out 
here and in general, and i know what needs to happen before i can do it... 
and i suppose my faith and courage have been lacking lately as well.
<br>
<br>
things could be worse...
<br>
<br>
I spoke to daria today and we spoke of making plans for her to come out here, but 
not before we talked about <!-- the mess --> her love life <!-- 's become --> and 
possible solutions.
<br>
i just watched <a href="http://www.culturevulture.net/Movies/DinnerGame.html" target="_blank">
the dinner game</a> and had quite a laugh, and the other night on my way home from 
eating italian with stephen and trish in mill valley, a deer crossed the street (and 
i mean a city street) right in front of me.
<br>
i'm just know i'm going to love it out here.
