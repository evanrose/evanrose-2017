i've been thinking of redesigns to this site, again, for the most 
part considering "one page" layouts, i.e. 86 the windows, etc.  the 
most difficult part is the idea.  thankfully the excecution is 
down pat.  i'm also thinking of improving navigation, as my navigation 
sceme leaves alot to be desired, especially for myself.  in particular, 
"previous" and "next" buttons, as well as a "return to today" button 
for the journal.  as for "work", maybe i'll just get to add more. 
when i have done what i'm doing now and get where i'm going, that'll 
get done.  it'll all get done in due time.

i was telling becky (while in line at the 
coffee haus just over a week 
ago when she said "we want you back" that i wouldn't be back because 
it would feel like too much regression, and that i was concerned about 
my image.  

<!-- 
amy told me that almaroe told her that if anything was wrong when i 
showed up on my "first day" that i should be fired.  how so very 
strange.  thankfully, trying to figure out why people think of me what 
they do is not very high on my priority list.  i told her to tell him 
that i was the best fucking employee that she's ever had ('cause its 
true).

now that i *am* back, i don't feel that regression, and i've 
realized (surprise surprise) no one gives a shit.  really funny how 
that is.  it doesn't feel like regression because working there again 
was something that i *wanted*, and is totally a means to an end.  
besides it will be over all too soon.

i'm driving out of here on may 11.  "so you're really going to 
go this time?"  sigh.  yes.  i'm really going to go.

i had breakfast at john's cafe with duncan this morning (cory's in 
l.a.) and it was really really good.
