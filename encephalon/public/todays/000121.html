larkin and john both told me this morning that this site was down, 
unfortunately, noone else noticed...<br>
i'm still a mess, but have had some wonderful conversations with 
some wonderful people 

<!--
larkin, marli, erin
-->

in the past few days that seem to have set 
me on an even keel.  how i needed that.

<!--
i still haven't gotten to talk to her.  i'm dying inside
--> 

<br>
<br>
i heard some great old songs on the radio on the way back home for 
lunch- "don't know what you got"/cinderella, "i remember you"/skid 
row, "when the children cry"/white lion, 

<!--
i've wanted to hear that one in particular over the past few 
years
-->

and "heaven"/warrant.  the eagle (kegl) was having a 80's ballad 
nooner.  i wish i'd gotten to hear more.
