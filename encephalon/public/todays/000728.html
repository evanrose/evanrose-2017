and do you know what happened 7 years ago today?

<!-- 
7 years ago, early this a.m. was when evan d. and i snuck out of our hotel room and got 
<a href="../writing/beginning.html">her</a>, and where i had my 
first near sex experience(!) before her dad showed up(!!).  

its also the night/morning 
that i think all of this officialy started; i.e. our exchanging addresses/telephone #s 
the next morning, and then her calling me 7 years ago, right around now.

so i think we are officially "chatting via email".  weird/wierd.  

she asked, rhetorically i believe, "I just wonder [how] we got back in contact  - 
what do you reckon the deal is?????"  

i hadn't thought about the fact that there might be a deal to "reckon" about.

mad irritation: for some reason, nothing wants to work on this computer of mine.  
its not recogning my digital camera when i hook it up, allaire homesite is pooping 
out, and a dll is missing from my icq net detector.  then i realized that there was 
a 
<a href="../writing/index.html" onMouseOver="imageChange('title','alt3','three','graphic1on'); window.status='writing'; return true" onMouseOut="imageChange('title','alt0','three','graphic1'); window.status=''; return true" onClick=openmain() target="mainopen">whole section of this site</a> 
that wasn't working (why doesn't anyone tell me about these 
things?  no absolute urls in server side includes!), so i put homesite together again, 
extended replaced, reloaded, and now everything should be fine.  whew.  i can't wait to throw this 
piece of shit out the window and get a real machine,  but that's the breaks.  
<br>
<br> 
though, when 
i think about how this is compared to all the work i did and 
<a href="http://www.inthehead.com/product/web/" target="_blank">all the sites</a> i 
developed on my crusty old laptop, i'm a very grateful guy indeed.
<br>
<br>
so mom's in town, we've been eating and chatting last night and tonight, she took 
the ferry into the city this morning and was going on and on about it kinda 
like <a href="000711.html">i did</a>.  however, i'm glad i don't have to take it anymore...
<br>
<br>
can life get any smoother?  i'm getting up an hour later and making 
it home an hour earlier than i was a week ago - and even going to sleep earlier.  
if life was any less chill i'd be dead!  
<br>
<br>
all i need now is a woman to pop into my life and 
fuck it all up.
