i've added some new art and extra links under "links", some midi tracks under "djencephalon" and under
"work"/aural, and some writings under "work"/literal/writings.  i'm probably going to do some
photos tonight, and some "work"/visual. 
</p>
<p>
wow.  more and more every day!  check out work/visual/sketches and paintings, as well as more
art links <a href="http://www.fashionquote.com/" target="_blank">(steve's)</a>, and that's it for today.  
here's more, just like i promised.  friend's can peep themselves in photos, 
<a href="http://www.hoopla.com/" target="_blank">hoopla.com</a> added to the links, and this site has been submitted!

its been an up and down week, haven't done much "work" as it were, and i can feel it.  i have gotten together
with people like i had said i would, my cousin stroud, jason, <a href="http://www.batique.net" target="_blank">andrew</a> (who 
i hadn't gotten together with in two years).  its been nice, however, there are some wierd things going on 
in my very personal relationships that i have become very concerned about.  it seems as though my feelings
of "not being ________ enough" have been true.  i've been trying to prove myself wrong, but cannot.  this 
finding (and yes, i know its not true, blah blah) hasn't bummed me out or anything, i just feel a little
 disapointed.  this could be very bad, and am trying to adjust, oh well.  getting back to work will make 
it all go away; it always does.

i'm leaving on vacation (san francisco and montreal) in six days.  after my play, this site, and a bad head trip,
i need it.
