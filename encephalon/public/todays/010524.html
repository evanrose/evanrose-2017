at home now i.m.ing d and driving her as she drives me into a frenzy of excitement and 
frustration after reading emails about contract work and a trip to china with my mama 
in october but i was on the boat yesterday, the boat i took every day last summer 
when i was at <a href="http://www.gap.com" target="_blank">the gap</a> - didn't feel 
like it was that long ago, now back working in the city again feels good, i'm just 
not getting worked very much - ok for this week as i've had my french final and a 
24 hour bug (and have been able to get my ever lovin' read on!), but my severence and 
(newly paid off) credit cards aren't going to carry me forever which is only one more 
thing that's been on my mind of late - along with the subletting of my place and the 
(oh please please please) place in oakland not to mention her move and the plan in 
general and everything that goes along with it; kinda makes my accounting and my 
epiphany about school 
(<a href="http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">architecture</a>!) seem 
sorta inconcequential and my week thus far and the past weekend, ost, tino corp, 
autechre, hanging with gates for the last time and going to 
<a href="http://www.form8.com" target="_blank">brian and nix</a>'s house, 
brian l's bday party, the city, record shopping and herbavore 
with 
<a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="blank">stephen</a>, a couple of films,

and starting and finishing "her" by anonymous and douglas coupland's

because i've only been working a couple of hours a day, a couple of interesting emails and 
continued correspondence and now a trip to l.a. tomorrow to hang out with 
<a href="000530.html">thom</a> and in general a somewhat stress free chunk of time 
is making me remember that it all really is inconcequential - and has been the whole time.
