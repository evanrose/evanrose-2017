there is lots and lots of very personal stuff going on at the moment; 
its times like these that i question such a public forum of expression/
timekeeping.  no matter!
<br><br>

1. i got fired <br><br>

 and i couldn't be happier.  a huge severance 
(bribe), and i don't have to deal with *him* any longer.  i'm thinking 
of becoming a bicycle messenger and a restaurant doorman, except 
i'm speaking with my friend 
who owns <a href="http://www.brainfood.com" target="_blank">
brainfood.com</a> about a job this week...
<br><br>

2. i met a girl <br><br>

 "thank you." "thank YOU." "NO, thank YOU!"
<br><br>

<!--  
i had to chase her over my headboard.  she ruined my mattress. 
i had sex only once in 1999.  how times change! 
-->

3. i am very disapointed <br><br>

 you know how people say "that 
person makes me sick"? i've never thought about a person that 
way, but this person makes me sick. its ok though. "we gotta do 
what we gotta do to stay sane, you know?" 
<br><br>

<!-- 
<a href="000117.html>she
</a> (check source code) invited 
me to spin her party and sent 2 of the drunkest people i've ever seen 
to pick me and my equipment up.  she spent most of the evening in the 
bathroom, then i ended up almost having a cab take me home (at fucking 
four a.m.  r. took me home instead (or maybe i took her home instead 
- she just drove) 
-->

4. i am very excited <br><br>

 parties, new jobs, new life, new ways of living, thinking
and doing.  i am so happy today. 
<br><br>

5. i am working <br><br>

 the coffee haus likes their 

site, and we 
meet to discuss metro coffee and money next week.  i'm also going to 
enter something in the <a href="http://sylloge.com/5k/" target="_blank">
5k award</a> competition, going to build a resume/
portfolio site for <a href="000206.html">
laurie</a> and a site for hollingsworth design, of which i am a 
new member. 
<br><br>

6. i'm feeling better than i have in a very long time.  <br><br>

 and it feels great.
