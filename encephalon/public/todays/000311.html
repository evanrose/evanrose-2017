i put a new 
<a href="http://www.inthehead.com/product/web/sites/swerveone/index.html" target="_blank">
swerve homepage</a> up today, and i believe its the finest work (visually) i've ever done.  
"i just like *lookin'* at it!"
<br><br>
i didn't hear from 
<a href="http://www.insite.net" target="_blank">insite</a> though.  sigh.
<br><br>god i'm disappointed!  i don't want to go work at an antique store.  
i don't want to work at a coffee shop.  i've worked really hard at 
learning to do this sort of thing because *i love it*.  i just wish 
i could do it for a living.  now that i think about it, i am 
doing this for a living - just not enough of a living; thinking 
about it this way makes me look at the situation in a more positive 
light.  i just need more <a href="http://www.inthehead.com" target="_blank">work</a>.
<br>
<br>
i don't know whether to talk about "when it rains, it pours", or "if 
its not one thing, its another."  they are both all too true today.

<!--
miss renee decided to write *and* call over the past 3 days, twice 
yesterday in fact.  i was enjoying an evening with carolyn when she 
called...
<br>
misty emailed too.  sigh.
<br>
no matter, there's plenty to look forward to over the weekend!
