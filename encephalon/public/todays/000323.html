i got my car back yesterday, after it rotting in the shop since feb 4. 
now all i have to do is figure out how i'm going to continue to pay 
for it; and speaking of paying for it, i have money in the bank, 
credit on my card, cash in my wallet, a bucket of change by my front 
door, and only two quarters.  the dryer downstairs requires three.

<!-- also ended up getting a 73 on my math test - much better than i 
thought, and surprisingly, better than most.  i'm stickin' to it.

jason b. and i listened to dave mathews (ugh!) the other day, a song 
about getting directions from a girl, then turning to ask if she 
wanted to get a cup of coffee and finding her gone.  reminds me of the 
girl from the subway in new york last july. why are these moments so 
memorable?  what do i find that i need in them? why can't i forget?
<br>
<br>
probably the 10 most intense seconds of my life.  
<br>
<br>
it also reminds me of the girl i loved when i was six or seven that 
i hadn't thought of in 10 years, before last saturday.  i don't 
remember any of it, save for imagined impressions of color and very 
blurry images.  it was so real that it amazes me, and i wish i could 
remember her name. i wish i could remember something about it.  i think 
i'd rather think about that than think about shit i go through now.
