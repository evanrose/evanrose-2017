sentiment was appropriate saturday night; having a good-bye dinner 
(on a four year old gift certificate c/o tom landry) with cory at
terilli's, 
i ran into *amber*, who i'd taken home from mick's two years ago, then 
had seen at the fair six months later... *she* recognized me, 

<!-- 
and told me then that her favorite word was "penetration".  i ended up 
choosing daria, a wise choice on my part.
-->

and saw 
ron d. sitting in with the band, and he joined us for a quick catch up.
<br>
<br>
sunday was all about tradition: john's, espresso's with candice and jason, 
kickin' it... made it back to my place to clean and pack until 3 am, then 
up and at 'em at 7:30 to load my car and vacuum.  that apartment was so 
cool.

<br>
<!-- 
cool enough for 
<a href="000117.html">misty</a>
to call (for the second time in as many months) to ask about getting 
in there.
-->

<br>
today i turned down <a href="http://www.homebuilder.com" target="_blank">
homebuilder.com</a>, and got a check to begin another project; all in a 
days work, but...
<br><br>
i just sent cory off to l.a., and i could almost hear a page turning, 
ending another chapter of my life, though the feeling for that sort 
of thing isn't there as much anymore.  i grow less and less sentimental 
as time goes on, however, i still have a long way to go (and a lot 
left).

link: <a href="http://www.skilla.com" target="_blank">
skilla.com</a> is pretty stinking cool, and makes me 
wonder why i'm even trying to build websites.
