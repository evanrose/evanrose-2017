tomorrow she will have been here one week - and adjusting ever since - in good ways, tomorrow will also 
be two weeks on the patch (except for a small slip last saturday - brain troubles, you know) and 
the time's been spent well, planning - the richard devine show, our place, her work situation, 
and the upcoming week, the show, our place, her work situation (heh) along with more fun stuff, 
so yeah - i'm kinda into new stuff at the moment and like i said 
<a href="010614.html">last week</a>, getting kinda bored with this...
