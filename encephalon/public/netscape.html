			<p>this site is an experiment, a performance art piece.  to that end, it is a playground 
			and development environment where i attempt to bear my soul to friends and strangers 
			alike while honing the skills that help me make my living.  the latest version of this 
			site is my first attempt at handwritten dhtml and if you are seeing this message, 
			you know it didn't turn out very well.  you see, for years i have developed exclusively 
			in netscape as that browser would catch all my mistakes and it made me the obsessive 
			coder i am today, however in trying to recreate my vision in ascii form, i have found 
			that netscape all to often renders code in a nonsensical manner and therefore, this once, 
			i have put up a website that is not displayable in that browser.  for the first time 
			i was not able to make my vision a reality in both browsers.  i know it can be done, and 
			i'll keep trying.  in the meantime, before i succumb to the guilt and put the old version 
			back up and/or figure out (heaven forbid) what's wrong with my code and fix it, please 
			consider opening up another browser and giving me another chance.  if you're so inclined, 
			you might take a peek at the source, see what the problem might be and give me a little 
			shove in the right direction.  if you want to send me much deserved hate mail, please 
			do so <a href="mailto:evan@encephalon.org">here</a>.</p>
			
			<p>one of your finest has fallen to the beast of redmond.  may i be forgiven.</p>
