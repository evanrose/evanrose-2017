<p>i felt a little funky after my 
<a href="001128.html">vacation</a> - kinda under the weather, then a little funkier when i dug 
<a href="http://movie-reviews.colossus.net/movies/o/open_eyes.html" target="_top">open your eyes</a> (recommended by daria over a year ago, 
worth the wait, and was it directed by the same guy who directed the excellent 
<a href="http://desert.net/filmvault/austin/l/loversofthearctic1.html" target="_top">lovers of the arctic circle</a>?) and even funkier still(!) as 
rufus was over last night after calling on friday to let me know he'd 
moved to sacremento so i cooked dinner and we talked all evening til 
<a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_top">stephen</a> got the party started 
digging hip hop source tracks and feeling soulful (rufus'll do that to you) but 
the funkiest part (besides discussing orgies and their concequences) was when he 
told me about being in love with a woman and how perfect it was, no matter where either 
of them happened to be, even when he had no idea what was to come next and i got to 
thinking about my 
<a href="001030.html">own situation</a> may have decided to "just don't call" which is strange and 
difficult for so many reasons - albeit simple reasons - but it ain't over yet, 
and its only monday and i got some boys to kick it with and some time and 
entirely too much 
<a href="http://www.zoza.com" target="_top">other</a> 
<a href="000725.html" target="_top">stuff</a> 
<a href="http://www.inthehead.com" target="_top">going</a> 
<a href="http://www.marin.cc.ca.us/" target="_top">on</a> 
so once again we'll just have to see.</p>
