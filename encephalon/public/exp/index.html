<p>
writing, though not posting from work (my backup directory is at home and i'm prone 
to forgetting about and then overwriting files, much to 
<a href="http://www.zoza.com/zine/bios/caseyd.jhtml" target="_blank">casey</a>'s chagrin 
so i'll just save this for later), 
because its boring and rainy and a slow starting kind of day and because the 
hug that i just received from diana has made me feel 110% better and curious that 
something so seemingly trivial and insignifigant as a hug should do such a thing 
and small memories of cory saying "brothers don't shake hands, brothers hug!" 
(and talking to him on the phone this weekend made me want to give him one) and 
realizing that i haven't had a hug in a week and don't give or get hugs on a regular basis 
and something should probably be done about that, 
and later, 
dinner with gates (after a mass exodus!) friday and coffee and discussion of the creation 
of furniture with geoff today, um, uh, wow is life peaceful at the moment 
(finally getting exactly what i asked for, peace, quiet, solitude) and my attentions 
have once again turned to the web and 
<a href="000708.html">my dreams regarding</a> what i want to do with my little 
slices of it as i spent all day yesterday messing with and absorping 
<a href="../php/" target="_blank">php</a> and <a href="http://mysql.com" target="_blank">mysql</a> 
(and increasing my "vpy" as i told hilary) 
in between scouring for javascript for the next version of this site and man... just 
feeling good about shit as i'd break in the living room and read about the 
<a href="http://www.moma.org/workspheres/" target="_top" title="method.com's new shit">history and sociology of the office</a> 
and when i couldn't stand it any longer, i watched 
<a href="http://www.timecode2000.com/" target="_blank">time code</a> and read 
<a href="http://www.dreamless.org" target="_blank">dreamless</a> and cooked my dinner and 
here i am, oh yeah (gettin' my link on)... here i am.</p>
