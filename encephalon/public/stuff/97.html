<br>
god this waiting is so exciting<BR>
i'm too calm to pace - it seems pointless<BR>
i'm patient waiting for it to begin<BR>
it?  i don't know what it is though<BR>
i don't want to waste now by<BR>
wanting it to be over<BR>
but i'm so bored - i am nothing<BR>
no plans no goals no her no money<BR>
all i have is myself, and time<BR>
lots and lots of time<BR>
time to sit and think and write<BR>
crap crap and more crap.<BR>
a new start is so refreshing<BR>
which is why i haven't gone nuts<BR>
the future looks good but now just looks<BR>
my mind is blank - feeling nothing<BR>
thinking nothing saying nothing<BR>
being nothing is not so bad<BR>
it has nothing, but potential<BR>
potential to be anything and everything<BR>
its cool 'cause right now, now?<BR>
i don't need plans or goals or her or money<BR>
i wanted to sit and think and write<BR>
and i got it (crap)<BR>
i think i should think and feel differently<BR>
oh yeah!  i remembered!<BR>
i do have something...<BR>
i have hope...<BR>
