yeah, alot to digest - words of wisdom and the ramblings of the insane make such sweet sorrow...

>oh, that's just sweet, man.
>just sweet.

yeah, totally <meta refresh> javaScript:history.go(-2) and cgi shit, i really dig it alot - 
speaking of, wrote my first inline java function yesterday, if/then shit.  it was live.

first of all, millions have nothing to do with it.  if you wouldn't be making money, i wouldn't be making money.  dig?  that means a free site, and i love the sites i've done for free.

that's a good question - an excellent question in fact.  approach...  if i were you, and i really wanted a website, i would start by getting some hosting at http://www.he.net - they have a form for "10.00" basic virtual host or something, you can fill out the form, put in your cc info, tell em what (ultrasecretbadasscool.com) domain name you want, give 'em 70$ and a 30$ set up fee plus 10 dollars a month (not bad for an infinite digital canvas/universal gallery space).  then i'd start putting my website up there and go from there.  it'll come if you want it to.  the more time you spend at it, and the more interested in it you are, the more you <b>will</b> learn.  

that's how i did, do, and will approach it, and i learn that much more every single day.

its real good.  just hook it up.  just do it.  you've got the info above, and you've got info i've sent to you - aside from minor details, ftp/telnet access, directory structure, things like that - you've got everything that i've got, minus a year of experience.  just one short year.

like i said... wait what sort of info are you wanting to order?  its all about he.net for server space tho'

and please continue to do so.

cool man - at some point you need to start reading http://www.peterme.com - a new friend of mine here in sf that i've been reading for more than a year, http://www.kottke.org, the most famous(?) weblogger, http://www.dack.com, a fave, and k10k when they come back up and perfect too.

>do you do consultations? or just bottom-up/top-down/whole shebang

tell you what my friend, i'll consult in this case (insert smiley face here)

you know, its really funny.  i get 60,000$ a year to work on websites.  how's that?  man you could totally get a job with my crew out here... you've got that zen thing they love so much down pat - not necessarily a compliment, but if you're talking about a fake job with real job pay - that very well may be it - and there are some cool motherfuckers over there too.

you know, a hip hop record might be in order - and on the real, since i've been here its been kind of weird thinking about being an adult and doing adult things and things like that, i did 5 years of vegabonding in dallas and sometimes - quite frequently actually, i get to thinking that my pursuit of things - not quite in the fight club sense but close enough for my taste - is really holding me back - then i remember that there are things i want to do:

i want to make music and spin records;
i want to build cool furniture;
i want to make "mixed media on canvas" pieces of art;
i want build amazing web sites;
i want to play the drums;
i want to cook amazing food;
i want to live with one amazing woman;
i want to have a network of like minded friends;

and having this car and this apartment and this job in this area at this time starts to make some sense, sorta.

i can't tell you how excited i am at the thought of your being out here soon.  send me details as you get them.
