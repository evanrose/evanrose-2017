<p>as if i haven't been writing to you the whole time.  heh.</p>

<p>first, i don't even go through women's purses when they ask me to get something out; 
making and having an email address and password for someone else could be just 
too much.  autonomy and privacy (pronounced of course in the king's english fashion) 
are usually my top priorities - i'll be looking into discretion later.
</p>

<p>
second, like i told you, an email address at msn.com can be checked by going to 
<a href="http://www.hotmail.com" target="_blank">hotmail.com</a>, inputting your username (the part 
before the @msn.com), selecting 'msn' from the dropdown menu and putting in your 
password, then clicking 'go' or whatever it is to get all up in your email.
</p>

<p>
we'll geek you out yet girl!  glad you're safe and sound in your new temporary(?) 
home, and of course if you *reealy* want me to set you up with a hotmail address, 
i will (you should go with yahoo tho', microsoft sucks ass).  if you just want 
something different, wouldn't d@inthehead.com or d@encephalon.org be fucking rad?  
sure would be, and could be forwarded anywhere...

<p>
very interesting getting an email and this being the only way i can reply.</p>
