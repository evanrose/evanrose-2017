wow!  what a completely uneventful week.  this next week should be cool, moving into a new office
 (my own office) at <a href="http://www.edanz.com" target="_top">work</a>, daria's coming back to town on wednesday, <a href="mailto:lwrose@flash.net">mom's birthday on thursday
</a> (happy birthday mom!), and thankfully i'm not sick anymore.  <br>
mad updates to the site, and hopefully this week i can get to work on building a new site using the knowledge i have stuffed into my 
head in the past two days for lauch by january 1.  sigh.  back to work.  <br>
click <a href="Bsf99.html">here</a> to hear about my trip if you haven't yet...

whew!  much better.<br><a href="http://www.edanz.com" target="_top">edanz.com</a> has gotten 100,000 hits in the past two days, it seems as though i was wrong.  we may be buying 
a new domain that will strictly be dance music radio, and running this thing might be my new gig.  still up in the air at the moment...(i wonder if they'd let me design the site? and yes,
i can do better than this one)
this has been a most "social" week, and it continues: coffee with don, daria in town, lunch with julie, 
dancing and parties, a new commitment beginning on monday... i'm trying to take an active role in the relationships in my life: i've been spending too much time at 
home, along, working with fireworks.  and speaking of which, i'm working with fireworks again,
 a new site should be forthcoming, but january 1 seems a bit soon (because of my computers crashing nonstop!!).  the black will have to do until then.

2 weeks left 'til the year 2000.  i remember being little and thinking how old i was going to be 
and how far i had to go until the year 2000.  i still feel like i have a long way to go.  <br>
i'm pretty upset right now; my laptop is broken.  its not even paid for yet.  thankfully i spend my life surrounded by 
computers, so work will be a little slower coming- not stopped.<br>
i've been thinking of things that i'd like to start (and stop) doing soon (like in 2 weeks maybe? new year's resolutions?), school, building furniture, <a href="http://www.edanz.com/modern/modern.mid">electronic music</a>, 

bigger, better, faster, more...<br>
thank you to whomever wrote <a href="#this">this</a>.

MOTTO<br>

This, then, is all.  It's not enough, I know.<br>
At least I'm still alive, as you may see.<br>
I'm like the man who took a brick to show<br>
How beautiful his house used to be.<br>
<br>
THE DOUBTER<br>
Whenever we seemed<br>
To have found the answer to question<br>
One of us untied the string of th old rolled-up<br>
Chinese scroll o the wall, so that it  fell down and<br>
Revealed to us the man on the bench who<br>
Doubted so much.<br>
<br>
I, he said to us<br>
Am the doubter. I am doubtful whether<br>
The work was well done that devoured your days.<br>
Whether what you said would still have value for anyone if it
    were less well said.<br>
Whether you said it well but perhaps<br>
Were no convinced of the truth of what you said.<br>
Whether it is not ambiguous; each possible misunderstanding<br>
Is you responsibility. Or it can be unambiguous<br>
And take the contrafdictions out of things; is it too
     unambiguous?<br>
If so, what you say is useless. Your thing has no life it it.<br>
Are you truly in the stream of happening? Do you accept<br>
All that develops? Are you developing?  Who are you? To
  whom<br>
Do you speak? Who finds what you say useful? And, by the
   way;<br>
Is it sovering?  Can it be read in the morning?<br>
Is it also linked to what is already there?  Are the sentences
   that were<br>
Spoken before you made use of, or at least refuted?  Is
    everything verifiable?<br>
By expeience?  By which on?  But above all<br>
Always above all else:  how does one act<br>
It one believes what you say?  Above all:  how does one act?<br>
<br>
Reflectively, curiously, we studied the doubting<br>
Blue man on the scroll, looked at each other and<br>
Made a fresh start.<br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
