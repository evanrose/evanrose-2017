<p>
hanging with stephen and justin last night was great, as was time with mom and nancy 
yesterday and today, and totally looking forward to seeing 
<a href="http://www.amontobin.com" target="_blank">amon tobin</a> (and 
<a href="010204.html">shiala</a>, 
who called after 2 months to see about getting a ride home after the show) here in a bit 
but i haven't been able to stop thinking about wednesday's conversation with 
<a href="http://www.zoza.com/zine/bios/caseyd.jhtml" target="_blank">casey</a>, beverly 
and diana as he broke down the future of our 
<a href="http://www.zoza.com" target="_blank">company</a> as well as the future 
of our jobs there which has had the unfortunate effect of making me feel extremely 
apathetic about my job and has woken me up to the fact that this "dot com downturn" is 
for real (no shit) and the thought of being here in nocal without a job and unable 
to pay my rent fills me with unimaginable fear, as slinging coffee and building 
a couple of little sites for folks ain't gonna cut it 
<a href="000229.html">like it used to</a> and so "what now?" i wonder as i have no idea 
when anything's going to happen or if i'll have a little something to cushion the blow 
and i wonder if i should go now or wait to get "severed" and all these other things 
one wonders when even though one makes a very good living one is still living 
somewhat paycheck to paycheck - so the waiting game i've been playing
 has bumped me to a more challenging level and there have 
been a few new players added and oh shit i'm not very good at this game but thankfully 
when this game and this fear become justifyable, they become a lot easier to deal with.
