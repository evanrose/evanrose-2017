<p>
after watching <a href="http://www.lastnight.net/" target="_blank">last night</a>, a film about the 
end of the world this evening i thought about 
the my version of the end of the world and where i'd want to be and what i'd want to 
do and with whom i'd want to spend it and where they, in turn, would want to be and do and 
with whom and wondered if any of those who i'd want to spend the final hours 
of life would want to spend them with me and perhaps i'd want to sit and smoke 
and talk on the phone with my mom and cory and daria as i coninued on the 
<a href="../stuff/todo.php3" target="_blank">programming</a>  
and (not yet available) <a href="http://www.inthead.com" target="_blank">redesign</a> i 
started today and wondered as i was watching why i wasn't where i *really* wanted to 
be as i've spent all week remembering 
<a href="010221.html">last weekend</a> and fantasizing about what life could be 
and opening perceptions and <a href="000401.html">seeing signs</a> (and deja vu) but 
sort of realizing that i and people in general sometimes don't do whats in their 
heads and hearts because the world would be a scary and chaotic place, however 
that's no excuse and as i wait for a reply from daria asking for a bit of 
reality and a bit of advice as well as continuing to wait for life to be what 
i'm trying to make it and for school to start in september of 2002 which is 
sometimes the only thing i think i'm staying out here for; just like when i was 
sixteen and couldn't wait to grow up and get over the atlantic to england and that one 
week in july of 1997 when everything went wrong as well as the 9 months of darkness 
that followed, i needed this, 
all of it, this now, this feeling, this way; i've always said "thank you", but 
never knew how much i meant it (because the world thank god isn't ending tonight) until now.
