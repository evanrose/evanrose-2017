incredible drive, saw dennis and his mom, ate, boulder rocks, 
drank coffee and kicked it, sushi at the fox theatre, kid koala 
and amon tobin were amazing (but talked shit to a dj's best friend...), 
boulder international hostel, drove from boulder to san francisco in 
16 hours, wishing i could have done it during the day.
<br>
<br>
since i've been here, i guess day 3 now, i haven't really done much 
of anything, and have been trying to get my mental situation straight 
(what's new?).  at times it feels very peaceful, at other times, i'm 
very afraid.  the void (that is my life)'s meaning changes from hour 
to hour...
<br>
yeah, i'm pretty confused.  this move and this attitude have stripped 
me of motivations and patterns i've always had, but since i've been 
here, my level of faith has dropped and i'm thinking that even 
though i was caried out here quickly and easily, things are going to 
stop being good.  another test?  maybe.  
<br>
<br>
trippin' sucks.
