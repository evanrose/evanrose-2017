<!-- begin entry -->

in addition to working 75+ hours a week, i've taken to reading again, and am 
back to 3 books a week (how does he find the time?!), now working on 
vonnegut's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385333471/encephalon-20" target="_blank">god bless you, mr. rosewater</a> (i think that's the title, 
i'm pretty tired today).  though my focus is narrowed to a pinpoint, which 
feels really really good, i've been noticing these purple patches with 
really fine wrinkles at the corners of my eyes; i need more sleep.

<a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">
stephen</a>, told me last week that we'd be seeing 
<a href="http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/releases/ninjasingles/zen1092/" target="_blank">
amon tobin</a> and kid koala 2 days after i get to s.f. 
(may 17) 
he then told me we'd be seeing 
<a href="http://www.stereolab.co.uk" target="_blank">
stereolab</a> soon after.  as it turns out, they're both playing the 
same night, and i still can't figure out if this is bad 
or not!

<br>
<!-- 
doesn't matter much anyway, i'll be seeing amon tobin and kid koala 
in boulder colorado on the 12, and we got tickets to see stereolab 
in l.a. on the 19th.  i guess we'll be flipping a coin on the night 
of the 17th!
-->
<br>

everything is still going as planned, like clockwork, and the 
focus has manifested itself into a drive and calmness that i 
didn't realize i had in me, and despite the outer excitement, 
there is this little core of peace and patience 
that is only looking forward to solitude and good work.
