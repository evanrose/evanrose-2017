<!-- begin entry -->

had a wonderful dinner/party with dave, maryanne, chloe, and my mom 
the other night.  thank god for good friends (and little babies!)
<br><br>
everything is becoming quite cohesive, got my place in san mateo nailed 
down, got some work coming in (already), flying to san fran on the 7th, 
back on the 10th for my algebra final, then departing on the 11th(!!!). 
i don't think i've ever been so excited (well, yes i have), but i 
haven't been this excited in a long, looong time.  in fact, i got to 
fantasizing about what it was going to be like to drive out of here 
on that day, that morning; coffee in hand, windows down, car loaded up, 
a little sad and relieved, stoked as hell(!)...

<!-- and never looking back! -->

<br><br>
its going to be here before i know it.  
<br><br>
i've also been throwing around the idea of throwing myself a going 
away party at the cafe izmir deli (at larkin's request), though 
i don't think anyone would show (at least not anyone i'd *really* 
want to see)!
<br>
<br>
had coffee with j. <!-- julie m., cory's ex --> last night and thought 
back to 
<a href="../stuff/97.html" target="_blank">
late '97</a>

<!-- 
late 97: lost danette, lost nicola, stole 10,000$ from myself 
and began a year and a half long lie, no job, no car, no place to 
live, all fucked up in the head, then 
sleeping on dave's sofa, getting a job, and coming back up.
-->

and how much things have changed in less than 2.5 years, which 
started me imagining possibilities and changes to come.  
<br>
<br>
after a while, i found i was "tired o' talkin' about it!" 
(though i'll continue to go on and on about it here, of course). i'm 
just ready to go.

<!-- and that is all there is to it. -->
