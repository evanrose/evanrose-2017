<p>so from here on out i am officially giving up weekends and hoping for a slumber that 
will take me away late on friday night and awaken me in time for breakfast and a nap on 
sunday to finally get me ready for monday and to get me past the boredom and restlessness 
that all day saturday and all day sunday bring on and interesting as i spoke with the four 
people who mean most to me in the world they each said in different ways that i should 
<a href="000511.html">go back</a> and after drama at work with our (so called) 
creatives and whatnot, it doesn't seem like such a bad idea sometimes, but then larkin 
helped me remember <a href="000124.html">why i left</a> and i got refocused and 
reorganized and it came to me 
(again) when hearing someone complain about some stupid shit that this is life and 
this is how it is and its up to me and all that and i know i'm gonna forget that shit, 
time and time again, but right this moment its in my head and the more energy and 
motion i build up with this thought, the further and futher the space between those 
introverted/spective times gets away from me but the check came in and 
got some shit paid and all caught up after all the expenditures that have gone on 
recently and already making plans for this weekend (coffee with seti, working at the 
new store) and next weekend (when a "friend"'ll be in town) and tonight after 
mad candy eating and late night coffee drinking my mood is where i'd like to keep 
it (except without the chemical use and the tossing and turning) and i've got a new 
design in my head, a lightning quick temper and recovering from a good laugh so i'll 
see and good show and finish out my week and worry about the weekend when it gets here.</p>
