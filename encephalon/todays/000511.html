today is the day, definately running late, definately off on the 
wrong foot (blowing off my mom for breakfast and all), but the 
day nonetheless.  i'm really glad i got to spend quality time 
with the people i have in the past week, and really glad that 
the people who came to my little going away party... showed up.  
<br>
<br>
five of us ended up at the expo lounge 'til 2, and it was 
very lovely, very relaxed, and they were for sure not the 5 people i 
would have 
expected to be the very last people i hung out with in this city 
this time around.  i think that made it all that much cooler.

today is all about getting my head together, and delaying 
gratification, i.e. putting off for just another moment this 
drive i've been looking forward to for so long.

<!-- bye! -->
