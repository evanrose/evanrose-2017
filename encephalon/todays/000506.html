damn its early, and am i sleepy(!), but stuff's gotta get done.
<br>
<br>
nobody "loves me", speaking of the virus, which is interesting to 
me; i guess i'm not directly connected to any of the "important" 
things going on on the net.  fine with me, y'all can have it.  not 
too long ago, i would have looked forward to getting it (and 
deleting it, of course) but losing my entire hotmail inbox 
last week has kinda soured me on email.  you know, i think i've had 
to re-work my whole idea of the internet.  the idea is easy to hate 
sometimes.  

<br>
<br>
i'm glad that real life is always there waiting for me with open arms.

<br>
<br>
after my last day at the p.c.a (which i spent working on 
vintage martini), 
i rolled home and worked then went and saw some old cronies play 
a rock and roll show 

<!-- charly p., james p., john w., and austin -->

that sucked so bad, it was awesome.  also ran into poppa.

<br>
tracie and i cruised to a regular smu party spot, and saw plenty 
more old friends and i got to say some goodbyes.  sigh, it was 
a lovely evening.  

<!-- 
oh tracie, (insert cory's "beautiful girl who kissed me" noise here)
-->

<br>
<br>
before the party though, i spent two or three hours cutting and 
pasting and coming up with 
<a href="../stuff/back.html">this script</a>, 
which is a "back button" hyperlink, 
which means clicking on it will take you back to the page you came 
from (great for templates!).  far from perfect though.  i'm new at 
this shit.  

<br>
<br>
yep, it always comes full circle.
