thank god in heaven.  my laptop is working again.  it seems as though a 
little tape can fix anything!  
this means that the new site is on its way, also a good thing, 
because then i'll be able to obsess on 
another site... my second night at a new job starts in 20 minutes, 
i'm working for cory again; though i 
don't feel terribly good about it.  my time is more valuable than 
it used to be.

i've bumped
 into 3 old friends today, and making holiday plans.  i love 
christmastime in a college town.  finally,
thank you to cory and stephen for the 
<a href="http://www.altavista.com" target="_blank">deal</a> that went
 through yesterday.  i only wish it could have happened sooner.  merry christmas!
