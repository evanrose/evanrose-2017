i just finished what i hope to be the final version of the 
coffee haus' website; working with those images and that background 
totally sucked.  on the brightside, "creative problem solving" has 
got my juices flowing, which is nice.  i'm able to forget about 
<a href="../stuff/mattandrebecca2.jpg" target="_blank">
her</a> blowing me off.

<!-- 
serves me right.  all i wanted was that ass,  once again; and i got 
blown off.  once again.  i think i'm detecting a pattern here...

jimmy mac came in today and had a meeting with jim about 
an antique dealer online auction startup.  i gave him my card.  now 
i'm thinking my hiatus from corporate america (is that what it is i'm 
doing?) might have been a bit premature.  i'm also fantasizing about 
ebay and sotheby's...
<br>
<br>
i had breakfast with cory <!-- who blew me off on sunday (!) --> and 
tried to help him out of a major funk, a funk i can't identify with 
at the moment.  it's always one or the other isn't it?
