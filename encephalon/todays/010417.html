seeing 
<a href="http://www.otnemem.com/" target="_blank">memento</a> 
(an extremely intelligent film - and an interestingly appropriate url) 
tonight with curita and pondering memories both real and imagined and 
their effect on the present - today i've started going through withdrawal 
remembering the airport "you have shoes and hair and...", the night of 
our dance in the living room, the roof, lots of time on the sofa, the whispering 
in her ear, listening to 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000DHRI/encephalon-20/107-2187757-1272517" target="_blank">restless by clifford gilberto</a> 
and the mirrors in michael's room, the party, the solution to the noise problem, 
the jam, feeling her and catching her eye from across the room, the bath, my mom 
asking "is your butt red?", her trying to mess me up while on the phone with work, the 
<a href="http://www.deathraydavies.com" target="_blank">deathray davies</a> show  
and being recognized from the stage, 

<!-- fucking in --> early mornings before the sun came up, late mornings long 
after the world had started, and nighttime, the little things that were said that 
meant and mean so much, her actions, faces and sounds, 
the speaking about our pasts hopes dreams desires 
fears possibilities with honesty openmindedness and willingness and more that will 
continue to come back to me and now, back again (like i never left, much 
like daria's explaination of her experience; two lives that pick up right where 
they leave off - almost seamlessly) in my life with material and practical 
fears and concerns that have led me to associations and comparisons... 

<!-- 
with danette, the other woman that told me she loved me first... their 
similar varied histories and (seemingly very high level) sexualities
-->

but they didn't affect me in the moment, those moments - but what is real(?), i wonder, 
the impressions and drawn conclusions and the waiting that will follow, or 
the moments that were so intenseley real but are now gone forever, except in my memory... 
and then the phone rings, and the now and the moment come together across time and 
distance again.
