very very smooth.  riding the boat.  working; s.f., san bruno, at home, soon 
in <a href="000708.html">larkspur</a>.  reading 
<a href="http://architecture.about.com/arts/architecture/library/zbookreviewz/bkr_0943233925_4301.htm" target="_blank">the house as a mirror of self</a> 
and fantasizing about getting one and building the furniture i'd fill it with.  spending time 
with friends.  talking lots of shop.

see her again!

<br>
life is so sweet i can barely stand it.
<br>
<br>
i left dallas two months ago <a href="000511.html">today</a>.
<br>
<br>
i turned in my notice at <a href="http://www.gap.com" target="_blank">the gap</a> 
today - and was told "if everything ever goes south..." i have someplace to come 
back to.  gonna fill <a href="http://www.aquent.com" target="_blank">aquent</a> in 
tomorrow, but i'm considering getting some off site work, cause like the muni 
driver said on the way over to meet with the crew at geoff's tonight:
<br>
<br>
"watch your step on the way out, 'cause it's all about safety".

link: i found 
<a href="http://www.jgk.org/" target="_blank">this site</a> once 
back in my <a href="000322.html">surfing days</a> and 
thought it had the most amazing utilitarian design and intuitable navigational 
scheme, didn't bookmark it 'cause i knew i'd find it again.  then i forgot how i'd 
found it, and didn't find 
<a href="http://www.jgk.org/" target="_blank">it</a> again for another 
four months.
