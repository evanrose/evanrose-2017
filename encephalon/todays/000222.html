i'm going to write a 
<a href="http://www.inthehead.com/people/resume.html" target="_blank">resume</a> 
today.
<br><br>
...another version (5k.02 beta) of the 
<a href="http://www.inthehead.com/product/web/sites/5k/index.html" target="_blank">site</a> 
that i'm going to enter in the 
<a href="http://www.the5k.org/" target="_blank">5k competition</a>.
<br><br>
i hung out at the coffee shop all day yesterday and 
ran into 
<a href="http://www.gullylove.com/jazzrevolt/musicians.htm" target="_blank">
earl harvin</a>, who invited daria and i to dinner 
with him.  
<br><br>
she freaked.  
<br><br>
we talked about music, the music biz, misc. shit, he's 
a wonderful guy, and getting to know him has been a treat.  everyone 
came up after he left (in his '65 volvo sports car) going "who is 
*that*?", and i felt 
<a href="000221.html">cool</a> 
again.
