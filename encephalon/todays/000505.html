coming down to the wire, baby.
<br>
<br>
so i'm packed, got all my bills paid, picking up checks, kicking 
out work, right up until the very last; its amazing to me still 
how rightly all of this has come together.  its next to perfect.
<br>

up a check

and having a metal rod (or something) get kicked 
up into my car that not only broke my entire windshield, but put 
a cute little dent on the roof.  oh man.  so after a bit of 
raging and an after rage calm, i got to finally speak to them 
about all the crazy shit that went down on

to be happening, and things are how they should be.  
<br>

and good conversation, i

remembered</a> this...
<br>
<br>
and i guess (after staring at this page awhile) that is all that 
matters.
