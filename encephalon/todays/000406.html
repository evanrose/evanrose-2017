i think i hate being an adult.  it seems as though i forced myself into 
it (quite a while back), but this time, i'll be paying the concequences 
forever (or at least the next 45 years or so).  now that i think about 
it, i seem to be in a window of time between adulthood and adolescence 
where i care very little about "activism", fashion, or my social life, 
(hence my problems dealing with 
<a href="../stuff/mattandrebecca2.jpg" target="_blank">
people younger than myself</a>), but i care even less about "adult" stuff; 
car, status, dental insurance, "settledness"...  sometimes though, i 
care what others think of me.  sigh.
<br><br>
which is why i've decided to do what i'm doing now, and feel about it 
like i do.  in fact given the circumstances, the answer should be easy, 
if not blatantly obvious.  

<!-- to some it is.  (wink wink) -->
<br><br>
it should be, but its not at times.  in 
fact its very very scary.
<br><br>
its scary thinking about regression.  

<!-- 
i'm going to work at the coffee haus again, and the only think 
i think about is a conversation i had just 3 or 4 days ago, when i 
told a cool customer there that no, i would not be coming back, if 
only because i don't want to feel as though i've regressed.  
<br>
i don't feel as though i've regressed.  right now i think i'm moving 
forward very very quickly, and man, i fucking dig it!
-->
<br><br>
its scary thinking about having 
to make it again.  its scary thinking about moving to a new place and 
finding out i was totally wrong about it all.  its scary thinking about 
discovering patterns in what i *think* is scary...

<!-- jesus.  ain't that the truth.  -->

<br>
<br>
because no.  none of this is important, 

<!-- nope.  none of it.  -->
<br><br>
except for the things that i 
deem important, and when this becomes an absolute truth, i will 
be totally free.
