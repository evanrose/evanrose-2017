<p>slipping back into the groove like a really comfortable pair of jeans is really nice, as 
is hearing from simona(!) and shaila 

<!-- with an accompanying pang in my stomach to her fasecious "just don't reply" message -->

in the past couple of days and then giving myself 
a redesign of <a href="http://www.inthehead.com" target="_blank">in the head</a> during 
a slooow ass friday (as has been the rest of the week at work) then went redesign mad 
and here we are except i'm feeling a rather high measure of guilt for this new deal 
not working in netscape - at least when border="0" and i'm thinking that my li'l ns4.6 is 
at fault - i mean, do a view source and look at that code and <a href="../contact/index.html">tell me</a> 
what's wrong as there is something (whoops, that's the sound of guilt overtaking me) 
but alas, my first (published) work with layers and dhtml shit and you know we 
all gotta start somewhere like with my <a href="../stuff/newyears.html">new years resolutions</a> 
which haven't officially started yet but the one that i forgot to write down was the one 
i practiced tonight, i.e. get out of the house and get down to the city and enjoy myself 
for chrissake(!) so i did and made it home at a decent hour for breakfast tomorrow with 
<a href="http://www.peterme.com" target="_blank" >peter</a> and some viewing of art later on in the day and 
its a little late but happy new year and speaking of which, i think this is the 
first year that i haven't waxed poetic in my mind about years past (however i did 
indulge in a bit of "<a href="000728.html">7 years ago</a>") and about "where i was one year 
ago today - <a href="000104.html">quitting smoking</a>, <a href="000117.html">misty</a>, 
all that... all that doesn't seem like it was a year ago at all and yet it might 
as well have happened in another life and i suppose if i think about it the right way, 
it did.</p>
