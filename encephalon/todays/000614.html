this site's been doing some acting up.
<br>
<br>

i spoke to my mom tonight about the messed up stuff that's been going 
on in her life, her knee, her work, hitting a dog with the car (it lived), 
and she reminded me of seeing clayton miller at the haight street festival 
with jenny jackson (high school people), drunk as hell.  thank god 
i don't have to do that <a href="000318.html">anymore</a>.
<br>
<br>
i also told her i had an interview with <a href="http://www.zoza.com" target="_blank">
zoza.com</a>, who <a href="http://www.smallpondstudios.com/" target="_blank">chris</a> 
had hooked me up with.  no shoes were allowed in the office, and a gong was placed in the 
"lobby" (as a ring bell for service, i assume). i think i'd really like to work 
with them.

<!-- 
apparently, the people who started it are the same people who started not only 
banana republic, but they started republic of tea as well.  their blowing up is 
all on their marketing, as they have an amazing product, as well as a great team. 
i think they're willing to pay me what i'm worth as well.

<br>
<br>
so i'm off to see 
<a href="http://www.sme.co.jp/Music/Info/SonyTechno/othersE/krush/index.html" target="_blank">
dj krush</a> tomorrow night with greg and geoff, then saturday night i have a ticket to 
see <a href="http://www.slis.keio.ac.jp/~ohba/srhome.html" target="_blank">steve reich</a>'s  
music for 18 musicians on saturday.  cory and i went up to see 3 nights worth of his performances 
last summer in new york, which was incredible.  

<!-- except for the part about cory and i going to new york, long story... -->

it'll be nice to be going by myself this time.
