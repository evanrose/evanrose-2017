things have been a bit better as far as mindset goes, worked on 
vintagemartini and then worked on getting a job thru 
<a href="http://www.craigslist.com/" target="_blank">
craig's list</a>.  stephen has some shit that's poppin' right now 
as well, and praying a little hasn't hurt a bit.
<br>
<br>
earl harvin was in town drumming for 
<a href="http://www.thethe.com" target="_blank">the the</a> and 
we got together for coffee before the show and caught up (daria's 
gonna be so jealous!), then met greg and casey, stephen and trish 
to go to the show (on the guest list with all access passes).  
<br>
<br>
it feels cool to feel cool.
<br>
<br>
and speaking of cool, i dropped an email to  
<a href="http://www.ninjatune.net" target="_blank">ninjatune</a>'s 
booking agent asking if she could help us get in to the 
amon tobin/kid koala/dj food show here, and got a pass plus one.  
totaly cool, as was the show, again.  now to get ready for an 
interview at <a href="http://www.perksatwork.com" target="_blank">
perks at work dot com</a>, and like stephen said: "it's all going 
to be fine."
