<p>participating in an unprecedented level of silliness usually reserved for people 
that i don't like very much and who i am so quickly able to lump into stereotypes 
has turned out to be way more exciting than sitting in front of this computer 
playing with code but i'm now sitting in front of the computer playing with code with 
my imagination perking up and feeling my age for once, i mean, who knew that doing 
things just a little bit differently (this design, this post, 
dressing up for court, and looking for different means to ends in general) would take 
so much boredom 
out of the equation - not that life is any different, mind you,  just experimenting a little bit 
after some (probably) much needed hibernation (which damn well better be over), 
and that's "<a href="000921.html">all that matter[s]</a>" but in addition to the fact that 
<a href="000518.html">earl</a>'s in town with 
<a href="http://www.thethe.com" target="_blank">the the</a> and jason and i are going 
(with tickets and all access passes - starting to feel kind of cool in here...) and then 
to a coworker's party afterwards, 
i am patiently awaiting being outside in the daylight tomrrow with my dear old friend 
throwing the football and talking shit while the whole world buzzes around us 
as i've spent entirely too many weekends unenjoyably <a href="000925.html">of late</a>.</p>
