<!-- begin entry -->

i woke up this morning (as i do on alot of mornings) with the bleakest 
and most depressing trains of thought, perhaps that's when i'm most 
"connected".  

<!-- 
in particular, i thought about how really dead and gone the past 
is; the women there, my experiences there, my life there.  this 
is a gateway to freedom.
-->

i think of fundamentals, life, the past, the truth.  
usually very very scary, but true nonetheless, and speaking of 
scary, true, "connected", and this morning, i couldn't connect to the 
internet (oh the horror!).  for the past 2 months, i've gotten up and 
surfed and emailed for an hour or so before beginning my day, and that 
habit is totally ingrained.  i'm now withdrawing.

<!-- 
and i believe this to be yet another sign. lately i've been 
intent on gathering clues from every event and coincidence in my life, 
trying to determine whether or not i'm on the right path.  i'm trying to 
let my "heart" lead me, and i'm trying to have faith that i'll be 
pushed in the right direction.  i'm trying to believe that "god" 
has an active role in my life, that he's letting me know that 
everything is ok, and that there's nothing to be afraid of. 
i take this connection thing as a sign because i can totally see how 
surfing the web and getting my email might be cutting into time i 
need to *use*, and it certainly doesn't help that the connection wasn't 
mine to begin with.

since san francisco has been on my mind of late, 

<!-- may 11, may 11, may 11 --> 

and i'll probably always associate her 
with that city, i've been thinking about 
<a href="../writing/you.html">
danette</a> and about how badly she wanted to be there.  we were both 
so all about other people (who where in other places), 

<!-- 
nathan and nicola, respectively.  i heard she was still over at 
the cosmic cafe, and i almost told charlie p. to tell her hi. i hope 
my news makes it to her, i even kind of wish her news made it to me. 
-->

and i can't believe we're both still here 3 years later.  i wonder 
if i'll ever run into her out there.

very interesting how possibilities and opinions change.
