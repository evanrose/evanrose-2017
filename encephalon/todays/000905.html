the fabulous weekend continued on sunday when  after i had coffee and oatmeal at the depot
<a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">stephen</a> and i rolled to 
the east bay to dig the 
<a href="http://www.ikea.com" target="_blank">ikea</a> store 
(where i came up with my own cheap and modular designs instead of making a list) 
and stroll berkeley where i picked up 
crass' 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001U0F/encephalon-20/104-2736877-9287905" target="_blank">feeding of the five thousand</a>, 
brian eno and david byrne's my life in the bush of ghosts that i think don recommended when he 
was <a href="000815.html">out here</a>, as well as a dj shadow single (all on vinyl), listening to the 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001SVNJ/encephalon-20/104-2736877-9287905" target="_blank">warp remixes</a> 
the whole way and tripping on how good life was and it was really really 
good then after all that was over with i rolled to the city chatting with cory the whole way 
who was on his way back to dallas after working in arkansas about his getting his shit 
together, finally, and when i got down to the haight i got my ticket and saw 
81/2 women at the red vic and though it was merely ok by peter greenaway standards, 
i can see why don hated it (!) and on the way back helped a guy who was looking 
for the golden gate bridge by letting him follow me through the bad ass presidio route 
and unfortunately today didn't work out as well as my weekend had as i woke up 
late and sat in a ton of traffic and worked on the dummy site 
(that i've been working on for more than a week) that ended up getting 
scrapped at the end of the day and speaking of scrapped, the 
<a href="http://inthehead.com/product/web/sites/laureladvisors2/" target="_blank">laurel advisors</a> people 
decided they wanted to wait on their site which was cool as i didn't much care for 
working with them, but damn that money would have come in handy but there's some 
stuff coming up with 
<a href="http://www.madxs.com" target="_blank">mad</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.moma.org" target="_blank">moma</a> and with school and work and training (at 
xuma this week and interwoven next week and atg the week after that) and moving 
even more that i'm trying to learn and get done i had enough on my plate already.
