a very relaxing weekend: a movie, erands and a nap, dinner, jazz and dessert, breakfast, 
introductions, work... the implications are staggering.
<br>
<br>
stephen trish and i went to an art opening, then went for dinner at mario's where we enjoyed 
the hell out of ourselves. then we 
retired to - never did find out the name, but as i was saying "lets listen to some 
jazz and chill" i saw a patio table under a heater and a jazz band with an open window 
in between.  we had amazing chocolate delicacies and excellent service, not to mention 
fine conversation.  got up this morning for breakfast and got some work from stephen 
for <a href="http://www.manbitesdog.com" target="_blank">man bites dog</a>, then we hung out 
with his apartment manager (the man who can make or break my dwelling dreams) who said in 
a turkish accent: "i don't keep a list - i'll let you know".  sounded really good to me.

<!-- he and stephen rolled up as we talked about 70s art rock! -->

<br>
<br>
i think the only things i would miss when i leave this place are the 15 fruit trees in 
the backyard - last week i was gorging myself on plums, then i discovered 
the nectarines are ripe.  so now i'm gorging myself on nectarines.
<br>
<br>
watching <a href="http://www.magnoliamovie.com/" target="_blank">magnolia</a> started the 
weekend off, and watching the charachters deal with such horrible stress and respond 
with such passion made me miss having things in my life that made me feel like i was
*really living*.  i remembered back to the middle and end of 97, probably the most 
painful time of my life, and wondered whether i'd used up all my passion then, or had 
turned it inward.  

<!-- 
the day d broke up with me, and later that night when she came over.  
then 6 weeks later when we were going to sleep together and i couldn't handle the truth 
and raged. 
--> 

<br>
<br>
if i used it up, that's very sad, and i'll eventually regret the fact that 
i used it up at the wrong time (and on the wrong person).  if i've turned it inward, 
its still there, only at this point in my life, that would be a case of severe misdirection.  
<br>
<br>
not that i no longer deserve it, but there are some things out there that 
are worth some risks and some energy, and i think i have some to spare.
<br>
<br>
i went to bed after i wrote this really down, really lonely, and not sure what 
to do about it.  positive reinforcement at 
<a href="http://www.zoza.com" target="_blank">work</a> today and getting some 
important paperwork in the mail today, as well as as conversation with 
stephen and <a href="http://www.alcatrazmedia.com" target="_blank">ryan</a> 
this evening has improved my mood though (not to mention a laugh over 
some of amanda and greg's <a href="../stuff/wedding.html">wedding pictures</a>!).
<br>
<br>
i need to get a weekend job.  relaxation is too much stress.
