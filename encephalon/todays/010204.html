<p>friday night wasn't as hard or as bad as i thought it would be, but i 
didn't at all want to do what it was i had to do, but like i told 
<a href="001210.html">her</a>, "one of these days you'll realize that i never 
wanted to hurt anybody, and that i was just doing the best that i could" and she in turn 
told me that there was a "real reason" cleverly hidden behind excuses but that i probably 
didn't know what it was - i think its a lot simpler than that, unfortunately for both of us - 
i just want to be alone, because time spent doing almost anything could be better spent 
alone, working and learning; i did, however, tell her that when she figures out what it 
was (is), she needs to write it in her journal and never tell anyone about it, but to be 
on the lookout for it all the same and the very next day, i helped 
<a href="http://www.ruthie-media.com" target="_blank">jen</a> move, again, but this 
time over to the east bay and now i'm again alone in my big sparse apartment which is exactly 
how and where i want (need) to be - about to get my reorginization and interior decoration on 
and enjoying the first peace and quiet (solitude) that i've had in a really long time and i'm 
thinking as i write this about being older and wiser but i realize that i'm not, really, just 
a little better at taking care of who i need to take care of and keeping my position on 
this planet amongst everyone and everything else secure.</p>
