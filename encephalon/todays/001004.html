old news is better than no news as at the moment i am doing nothing but 
working and schooling and this weekend will be hanging out with 
<a href="../stuff/jason.html" target="_blank">jason</a> who is in town 
and planning on doing fun things with the oh so cool people i work with 
but anyway... 
so a week of nothing but work ('til 1am on wednesday and all day saturday) 
and school and being absolutely disgustingly broke has 
passed with only coffee and a

show with trish - as stephen 
was in dallas for the week - to break up the monotony, however focused that 
monotony allows me to be, reading

and thinking and planning the rest of my life and being very financially concious 
and now that i think about it very surface and as a result, very peaceful 
though (apparently) a bit unfocused - whoops; contradiction - but it matters 
in the not in the slightest as i'll start another week of work tomorrow and  
will continue to be broke until i finally make some money then maybe get some 
furniture and finish school and see lots of shows and maybe take a trip or two 
then maybe get a really excellent job and meet somebody and settle down and 
raise a kid or two and the next thing you know, years and years of days like the 
one i've had today, where i've gotten up and had coffee and hung out and did some stuff 
and ate some stuff and maybe even took a stroll and talked to some people and 
read some stuff will have passed completely uneventfully and right this second that 
sounds really really good - sort of like i'm doing the right thing, unfortunately 
for me and my set in my ways-edness and adulthood(!) i learned that rufus 
was on his way out here as he's in the midst of one 
of those life things - one of those shake ups that people like us tend to go through 
and i can't wait to sit down and find out what's going on and have a discussion and 
get a reminder that this life - though rather boring at this particular moment - is 
absolutely the most frustrating and fantastic thing i will ever know.
