<!-- begin entry -->

<p>this week i got court taken care of, stayed home sick on wednesday, made jason s. and cory proud (and a certain 
<a href="http://www.foreigneronline.com/"target="_blank">foreigner</a> song comes to mind...),  

<!-- i took shaila's virginity this morning. it was a first for me too.-->

found out i made a 4.0 (that's 3 As in a row) last semester, saw 
<a href="http://www.tigerstylerecords.com/tristeza.html" target="_blank">tristeza</a> 
and <a href="http://www.forcedexposure.com/artists/single.cell.orchestra.html" target="_blank">miguel</a> and 
<a href="http://www.billynayer.com" target="_blank">the billy nayer show</a> at different times 
and places with different people, and at some point this week i realized that i don't spend 
very much if any time thinking or talking about the future (though i remembered 
today what started a <a href="000117.html">year and two days ago</a>) 
and i wonder if its because i can't 
stand people who talk incessantly about what they're "gonna do" (i seem to overhear lots of 
those conversations at clubs) and not what they *are* doing and though i haven't started 
talking about it, i did hear that a little fantasy i have of moving over to berkeley (to 
go to school and live above a coffee shop and get rid of my car and ride a bike and work at home) 
is not a possibility this year because of a requirement that new students be admitted only in 
the fall and only after applying a year beforehand and that made me think of living in mill 
valley until september of 2002 and what i'm going to do until then and about how i'm not waiting  
for things to come together anymore and about the fact that i'm here in california doing what i do 
and building (not a new life but) a life and home for myself with a job i love and talents and time 
and californian friends and suddenly i'm not thinking about the future but instead the here and now 
and wondering what can be done with what i have at hand and once again i am doing 
exactly what i need to do and i'm exactly where i'm supposed to be.</p>
