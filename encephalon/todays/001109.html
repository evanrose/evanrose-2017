<p>it was very nice on sunday and the test didn't go too well and work before it was nice again 
on wednesday when we saw the technicaly and emotionally awe enspiring 
<a href="http://www.requiemforadream.com" target="_blank">requiem for a dream</a> which turned out 
to be much more of a date movie than i thought while watching it and we held hands 
and came back to my place and we sat on the sofa for hours and hours and i ended up spilling 
my guts and telling the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and it was 
very good being so free and so comfortable with someone who i was very interested in being 
free and comfortable with and she stayed the night and was a good girl and was delivered 
to her doorstep in the exact same condition as when she left it and before going to 
sleep ("you'll know" she said) i had begun to tell her one last story about my time with 
daria, actually the time 
<a href="000921.html">not too long ago</a> 
when daria was on my mind and i saw another 
<a href="http://www.affairoflove.com/" target="_blank">moving film</a> 
that reminded me that it is so easy to take the easy way out and not work at something 
that could be so worthwhile because i'm waiting for something that i think might be 
right around the corner and its easy to "just don't call" 
so i'm here tonight too tired to go out to a going away party 
because of java hacking and another test and i'm remembering her telling me the exact same 
thing daria told me two years ago in 10 days - that i shouldn't wait because we'd just go 
through the exact same thing again; interesting, as i'm going through the exact same 
thing - again but i feel very different about it, like maybe i've grown, maybe i've grown up, 
maybe stuff just doesn't feel like it used to - which is good - good for las vegas this weekend 
with jason, 
good for my <a href="http://www.inthehead.com" target="_blank">work</a>, and good for things 
that i know i'm not finished with yet.</p>
