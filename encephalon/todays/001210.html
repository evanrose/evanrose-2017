<p>"cancer (june 22 - july 22) although it's impossible for you to make a permanent 
commitment now, maybe you don't have to tote the barge and lift the bail all alone.  
trust has become an issue for you (with darned good reason, of course), but if you 
refrained from childishly believing that anybody is going to come along and save you 
from yourself, you could enjoy companionship even for five minutes." is what i read in the 
<a href="http://www.aa.com/away/" target="_blank">american way</a> 
during my flight from montreal that spoke the 
truth to me about my situation(s) with all these women that i've placed all this phantom 
importance and unrealistic expectations on - but it seemed irrelavant as i carried on 
*waiting* for shila and thinking every time we ended up over here that something 
different was going to happen (much like i did back in 
<a href="../writing/thatgirl.html">'97</a> when i waited and waited and waited) 
so after last night i decided 
(for the time being, of course; heh) that i wasn't going to wait and that it really 
wasn't worth waiting for - as there's so much more to it than waiting and i also realized 
yesterday at the zenith of a stressful and messy week that included trippin' over upcoming 
finals, an ever increasing to do list at <a href="http://www.zoza.com" target="_blank">work</a>, 
and just plain ol' self punishment (but a lovely friday evening with justin and 
stephen at <a href="http://www.sfstation.com/clubs/joypad.htm" target="_blank">joypad</a>), 
that i didn't need the hassle 
(at least for today) - my life as it is right now is hassle enough so today i've maxed 
and relaxed and caught up and begun dreaming of (stolen/found) art and (self made/styled) 
interior decoration and an upcoming vacation and 
<a href="../stuff/newyears.html">new year's resolutions</a> and making it through the week 
ahead.</p>
