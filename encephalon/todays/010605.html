after los angeles, hanging solo on the sunset, melrose and eating at duke's 
and swingers, the party and the star struck people at every turn, then 
a day of rest, then a messed up sound system at fuse, the funk was 
lifted when she came back - <a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">our</a> 
first night at 
<a href="http://www.26mix.com" target="_blank">26 mix</a>, more 
time in oakland seeing our place and the lay of the land, enjoying the air, her 
good cooking, planning, buying a franklin stove, the city and each other, 
looking forward to plans that have been finalized, the 15th of june when 
she'll be here for good, then july the first, starting a new chapter with a 
new co-author with foundation that we've both been laying seperately for a 
long time - preparing for something neither one of us knew about but 
knew we wanted and needed; the foundating we've been laying down since 
february like it was (and it was too) meant to be - and even her slip this morning 
during her long trip back to dallas and my subsequent willful picking up 
of a pack of smokes after 4 clean days isn't that much of a big deal - 
its a process, a work in progress, one we'll have plenty of time to work 
on and as i reorganize and get my mind around preparing for all of the logistical 
things that need thinking about and working out, sublet or break the lease? 
school? new shows and gigs? with new 
<a href="http://www.ambientairlines.com" target="_blank">friends</a> and 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=jonas+judd" target="_blank">crew members</a>? 
buckling down, quitting for good and finally getting healthy? yeah (say "yes" to 
the universe), all of that.
