<p>
six years ago yesterday, i spent the day crying, shaking and coming down, and six 
years ago today i had my first day of continuous sobriety - then in the first 
year moved home and worked downtown, met cory, moved into my first apartment with my first 
roomate, jennifer j. and worked for terrilli's 
then moved with my friend stan into a big 3 bedroom house and got my first car - the 
second year i moved home and saved money, 
then went to school in rome for a semester, then met 
<a href="../writing/thatgirl.html">danette</a> and moved in with her - the third year 
was a mess, the fiasco with stan's truck and living at his mom's house (where i 
got really into the internet and got my first email address) and getting into the 
coffee business and 
being out of work for 3 months, then 
going to <a href="../writing/nonfiction.html">paris and london</a> followed by 
sleeping on dave's sofa for 4 months, working at starbucks and the coffee haus, 
then finally getting my very first own place - the fourth year i met daria, 
as well as meeting and/or solidifying relationships with 
the people i call my closest friends today, larkin, 
<a href="http://www.lozenge.net" target="_blank">john</a>, 
<a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">stepen</a>, matt a. and many more - 
the 
<a href="000318.html">fifth year</a> i worked for 
<a href="http://www.edanz.com" target="_blank">edanz</a> in 
my first office job and started building a website, and the 6th year, which includes 
coming to california and more that's already been documented here and which has ended  
today as i (by god's grace) start on my seventh by dealing with my sinuses and 
rearranging my apartment, is history.
