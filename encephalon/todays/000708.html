i cannot stop thinking about a form interface to update my sites with, and running 
my sites at home on my own partitioned machine, and 
database driven applications, and server side includes, and document 
writes, and c and perl and xml, and asp, and and and... 
i'm forever thinking of new concepts to add to this website, and of better 
integrating my sites together, to express how i feel about the web, what i like 
about the web, and my relation to the web.  i've just gotten an account at 
<a href="http://www.pitas.com" target="_blank">dairyland</a> for a 
"weblog" (ideally, in the <a href="000322.html">intented sense of the word</a>) to not 
only have another mode of output, but also get that much closer.
<br>
<br>
i find some great shit out there, and don't *even* have time to spread the word.
<br>
<br>
i spent the first twenty one years of my life thinking i was never going to 
find that thing that i would love to do and want to do forever and 
i love it that i love what i do so much that i want to put my heart, soul, 
and life into it.  i want to push the bounds of this medium and of myself until 
we meet in the middle.  its an amazing thing. 
<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.gap.com" target="_blank">the gap</a> is a mess.  
the two sides of the system i work in seem to be competing with each other 
instead of working as a whole, as a team.  the problem is is that one side is 
in another city working on the backend, and we (see what i mean?) are in the 
city working on the front end.  noone is ever going to get fired because problems 
that arise are "san bruno's fault", and vice versa.  most likely, these phenomena 
are unrelated, but i wonder if this has anything to do with the fact that whenever 
i step into the bathroom, there is never anyone standing at either of the two 
urinals, but invariably, there is someone sitting in a stall... 
<br>
<br>
hey, i'm a contractor.  its none of my business...
<br>
<br>
so my birthday passed with little fanfare, heard from some friends i hadn't heard from 
in a long time (

<a href="000117.html">misty</a> <!-- view source -->

and rufus, who didn't know) and daria (who kinda knew) called from madrid (or barcelona?  
does it matter?). mom called first, cory called a day late, my dad didn't call at all... 
<br>
<br>
i got taken out to dinner last night with the crew, but i think the best gift i 
got was an offer from 
<a href="http://www.zoza.com" target="_blank">zoza</a> (including 20,000 
options, what's up now?), that i believe i'm going to 
accept.
