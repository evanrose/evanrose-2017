interesting correspondence in the digital age, writing interesting emails and 
interesting letters in the same frequency because the nuttiness and emotion of 
spring has sprung a bit early this year, i mean for christ's sake i'm thinking 
it could have held off until the solstice but what waits for no man(?) but today 
as work slowly passed before me, i, over a cigarette came up with the idea 
that is the dream that i'd traded for the "american" version which has never 
been my version (as i was going to give that up, remember ["this morning i woke 
up with london in my nose and knew that i'd made a mistake"]?) but that sort of 
thing is so easily forgotten but like i've been telling 
<a href="001204.html">rufus</a> in an emailed conversation tonight, i'd forgotten that 
life is to be lived like i want it to be lived, or about how i'd gotten caught up 
with how i thought it was supposed to be lived or something along both lines of 
reasoning that resulted in the realization that i was doing a few things wrong, 
another couple of things not whole heartedly, and avoiding some things all together... 
while leaving some things unfinished and i also remembered today over that 
smoke in the sun between reading about

and tweaking the (goddam that's) 
beautiful (if i do say so myself) 
<a href="http://www.inthehead.com" target="_blank">redesign of in the head</a> that 
i have the talent and the resources and a sufficient network of like minded energetic 
beautiful people that i can live as i choose and make the system work for me 
because like i wrote, on plain old paper in yet another letter, home is wherever 
i happen to find myself, work is wherever my computer is, and love is where my 
people are; hell of an idea, huh?
