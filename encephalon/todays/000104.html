oh i am a mess.  sitting here at this computer with nothing but horrible
thoughts flowing through my mind.  "i am useless".  "i'm not doing the right thing."
  i want to smoke.  i feel as though i am wrong on all levels.  i am the wrong 
person at the wrong time with the wrong stuff.  
</p>
<p>
images flashing= daria on the phone telling me it was a mistake not going to 
europe.  typing "i'm not good enough".  the thought of things always being this way.
  i know they won't be, but it makes me wonder if my thinking that means i'll laugh 
again or will true.... 
</p>
<p>
oh my goodness.  i am absolutely out of my mind.  i am going to sleep.
