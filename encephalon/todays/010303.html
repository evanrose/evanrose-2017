<p>
after being told i was completely out of my mind - in a good way and noticing 
signs saying that my work here was only just begun, as well as an email from 
<a href="000117.html">misty</a> with whom it was never the same again until i called 
and we caught up and she let me in on her "little secret", i got another email that 
implored me to make another call and i heard 
<a href="../stuff/d.html">d</a> tell me she was broken, she 
was finished, she was leaving, perhaps for good(?), good for her and good 
for me as well as acting on that fabulous irrationality, that fantasy she started 
in my mind that made me realize so much up to and including that she, at this point ("so 
different and so new"), 
is a symbol, a goal, an ideal i was working toward anyway and her leaving reminds 
me that my objective is not the (now even further away) light at the end of the 
proverbial tunnel, but the jouney ever towards it (as i don't really want 
what i have or what is handed to me, i want that that i continue to work for, 
the wanting makes me want it more), the means as opposed to the end and still 
i am reenergized, for more, new and different work, ever increasing financial 
freedom, copious amounts of reading and learning, 
and <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com" target="_blank">seeing the work of</a>, 
keeping in contact with and spending time with old, semi-new and new new  
friends, like  
today's enjoyable breakfast and conversation with 
<a href="http://www.peterme.com" target="_blank">peter</a>, dinner and more enjoyable 
conversation with jill, and now a movie with beverly then the money mark show with the crew, 
as well as the <a href="http://010101.sfmoma.org" target="_blank">opening last night</a>, 
while smiling as i dreamt of a greyhound bus to marin (which is cute *anytime* 
and 'cause this ain't over yet;  
but waiting patiently for things to fall together like they always do and 
perhaps my talking of leaving inspired her to go like her taking care of herself 
right now has 
made me looking into doing the same for me and oh my goodness there is 
so much going on tonight, shows and films and people...) and am, like i 
was saying before i was so lovingly interrupted, continuing on.
