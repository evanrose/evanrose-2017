i cannot stop thinking about getting out of here.  ny.  sf.  somewhere 
else; i don't care. 
 <br><br>
somewhere where stuff is going on- and places are worth going and things 
are worth doing.  a place where the vibe is good, and the weather is 
good, where stuff is getting done. 
<br><br>
i <B>feel</B> good today.  (got my head shaved yesterday.  hard to 
feel bad when you got a bald ass head to rub!)

<!-- correction: i feel <I>better</I> today. -->

<br>
<br>
its so nice - thinking 
about stuff i'm going to do, and thinking of the stuff i'm currently 
doing; not thinking about how shitty i've felt recently.
<br>
<br>
dave and i quit together.  i think we're gonna make it.
<br><br>
i saw 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CWPX/encephalon-20" target="_blank">fantasia 2000</a> at the imax last weekend- it was beautiful.

<!-- 
cory was so angry when i told him what had been happened between 
her and i, and that 
i had kept it from him on purpose (for all sorts of reasons), and 
at the time i needed him most, he sat there acting hurt.  we've 
made up now, but a rift has been a long time coming.

he told <a href="todays/000117.html">her</a> that i'd been smoking 
(when he dropped by the other night...) 

i wish we could all leave each other alone.

she called two nights ago, and left a message.  i called when i 
got it.  she hasn't called me back yet.  

thank god it isn't like it was a week and a half ago.
