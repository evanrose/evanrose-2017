so sunday night was totally chill which i guess was that way in order to prepare me for the 
week i've had so far (and ideally the weeks will continue to be this way) which started 
out innocently enough i mean my <a href="http://www.webtrends.com" target="_blank">webtrends</a> 
project came together, worked on unix (and even thought about installing linux on one of 
my machines and speaking of linux, i met the guy who started 
<a href="http://www.linuxcare.com" target="_blank">liuxcare.com</a> on the boat today which is 
cool because i'd probably need lots of support) and edited my first file in 
<a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/ccso/computing/Pico.html" target="_blank">pico</a> before sitting 
in some meetings but then i got assigned a project that's going to 
involve me learning a whole bunch of new shit and building a huge dynamic website that 
at the moment i have no idea how to do but i have six weeks to do it so i thought about that 
and the email about some possible freelance work up until the time when i went to 
school and heard about biology from a wonderfully nerdy professor then made it back 
to the house to crash cause i got up at 5:45 this morning to get the boat to the city 
to go to training at the <a href="http://www.atg.com" target="_blank">art technology group</a> 
which is a totally rad name and they have a great product (the dynamo server) but the 
training sucked until 3 when i left to meet devon at <a href="http://www.aquent.com" target="_blank">
aquent</a> about some side work and then over to another company from whom i'd received 
the email about more freelance work but ended up hanging out with 
<a href="000731.html">billy</a> before the meeting 
that went pretty well except for the fact that i was hoping for a check because i've spent 
$1174 on school and $300 on getting my car and liscence all california'd out and i've gotten 
a new insurance policy and a subscription to <a href="http://www.wired.com" target="_blank">wired</a> 
which was only $12 for a year but i'm flat broke now and i'm really wanting to get into that 
place in mill valley and its gonna be tight but if that credit check goes through i'm in but 
that didn't stop me from calling 
<a href="http://rodan.asu.edu/wcb/students/edanzige/edanzige.html" target="_blank">evan d.</a> 
(who dropped off my radar 4 years ago and heard from 
out of the blue 
<a href="000817.html">the other day</a>) on my cell phone and he told me that he was going to be in 
on friday night visiting his grandpa with his whole family who i haven't seen in forever so 
i got off the phone and onto the boat and red about cgi scripting and talked about linux 
then got off the boat and jetted to the office for a quick peek at my email before rolling 
to school again and hearing about astronomy from an oddly nervous and shy teacher and 
all i could think about was how i could go about starting a conversation with a girl 
(any girl) which was prompted by seeing many lovely young ladies in the class but i didn't talk 
to anyone and came home quickly and checked the email again and wrote some stream of concious 
shit that i lost when i unplugged the computer but continued on this kick anyway and 
now i'm thinking very seriously about keeping my journal like this from now on and i think i 
might do that but in the meantime i'm tired as hell and have to do all of it well not 
the meetings or the school but atg again to tomorrow.
