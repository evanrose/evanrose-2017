<p>yes, its good, its very good, but <a href="001028.html">watching contempt</a> entirely in 
english was not so good, as all of the humour in that movie comes from jerry's assistant 
who "translates" for him and it makes me wonder how many people saw it the way i saw it 
on saturday and wondered "why that bitch kept running her mouth every time jack 
palance opened his?" but it was enjoyable anyway as was working in zoza's walk in website 
with the oh so sweet dana and almost sweeter sook and remembering how much i like 
<a href="000305.html">working in public</a> then biology lab jill and i kicked it at the depot 
with a very depressing old man before i got back to get my study on for the midterms 
that are now coming in droves but i talked to <a href="../stuff/jason.html">jason</a> and 
daria and got emails from my dad letting me know that kara s. had been given my email 
address (!) and from rufus letting me know he was rolling to sac town to work for 
<a href="http://www.sacbee.com/" target="_blank">the bee</a> and beverly left for surgery today and 
<a href="http://www.zoza.com/zine/bios/caseyd.jhtml" target="_blank">casey</a> and i shopped and 
ate thai and got more props from the coo and woke up after dreaming of 
<a href="../writing/beginning.html">nicola</a> and even called the young lady that stephen and 
i met on friday and plans were made and i feel so good right now that i could almost split 
and i knew this was coming and everyone told me this was coming and god i'm so glad that 
its here and i'm here to get it, and thank you to whom/whatever for allowing everything 
to be as it is (and as it was to cause this) and for helping me to remember that its 
people who matter, and that i am people to everyone else.</p>
