coming to terms with alot of what's going on at the moment, work, life, all that, i think 
i've come to making a decision.  tonight i have a date with my mom, and she'll love it that 
i need some advice (or perhaps just some validation).  
<br>
<!-- i believe that i've decided to go to s.f. next month. -->
<br>
things are being tied together like the <I>&lt;!--park in montreal--&gt;</I>.

i saw 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CXGA/encephalon-20" target="_blank">hi-fidelity</a> last night with tyler, great film.  reminded me of alot, myself in 
particular, on all levels, danette, records, san fransisco, 1997...  "rob" (cusack) 
said something 
along the lines of commiting suicide very slowly by never commiting and always keeping an 
eye out for something "better", which is only a fantasy.  this rang true then, and its 
ringing true now.
