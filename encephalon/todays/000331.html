yep, still under construction.  i am completely unhappy with what i've done (feels 
like rehashing the same old crap), and 
have even begun to rethink about what it is that i'm trying to do with this.  its 
fun, yes, but when i'm not pleased with the outcome of a fun project, the project 
is no longer "fun".  time to throw a monkey wrench into the works.

i'm on my lunch break from the flash class i've been looking forward to for the 
past 2.5 months, its super-duper cool, and i'm already excited about the 
possibilities; anything would be better than 
this.
