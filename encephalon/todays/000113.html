crazy roller coaster rides!  paul hated my disco so much that he almost 
fired me (last i heard, 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000337I/encephalon-20" target="_blank">"we are family" by sister sledge</a> 
was disco...),
 saying i was "not thinking", "fucking stupid", and "sleepwalking".  
<br>
<br>
i told him he shouldn't think that way.
<br>
<br>  
my laptop wasn't taking discs which made me decide to destroy my desk chair,
 which ended up taking my telephone and a chunk of my wall with it. 
<br>
thankfully, (filmmaker) megan and (coworker) john and i had a nice lunch at 
my place - discussion of her project over spaghetti and salad, then 
a five hour coffee date with whitney.
<br>
<br>
its been almost two weeks without a cigarette.
