such a big day, yet so little has gone on; my favorite kind of day.  
t-shirt, flip flops, jeans rolled halfway up my legs, all over town 
on my bike. picked up yo la tengo's new one, "and then nothing turned 
itself inside-out", as well as "i can hear the heart beating as one" that daria stole. my 
best friend has lost his company, as mine has more work than it can 
deal with (almost...).  
<br><br>
communication problems, relationships and *fundamentals*. 
sometimes i under-estimate the power of social experimentation, 
especially when i have stakes in the outcome.  it seems so pointless 
and stupid, but oh so worth it.
<br><br>
yessiree, i've had entirely too much time to sit around and think 
recently, but it certainly could be

worse</a>.

putting off listening to my new cd feels really good.
