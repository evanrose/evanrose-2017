<!-- begin entry -->

don p. is out at the moment, and i've been enjoying the hell out of his company since 
yesterday afternoon (where we realized that we happened to have a very interesting 
friend in common...). 
 
<!-- 
he told me he was seeing a catholic priest, and right away i knew it 
was micheal windsor.  my mom about shat her pants when she heard.
-->

he's helped me tune in to all of the negative energy that's 
surrounding my house and realize why i've been so up and (mostly) down lately.  though 
trying to convince him to come out here over dinner this evening reminded me 
of how much i love it out here, no matter what my situation might be. 
<br>
<br>
some new developments over in mill valley might be the solution to 
all my problems.  a 2 bedroom has opened up for stephen and trish, and their 
place might be opening up for me.  a(nother) dream come(ing) true.  another 
cool thing in a week of xml, flash, webtrends,  finding 
<a href="http://www.launch.com/Promotional/steve_reich_ft.html" target="_blank">steve reich</a>'s "drumming" (finally)...
<br>
<br>
not to mention an interesting email conversation today where 
<a href="../writing/ending.html">she</a> said in her signature style:

<blockquote>
"Your latest entry - 12th Aug - reminded me of wasted Sunday afternoons 
watching Dawsons Creek - it was almost as if you were a parody or yourself - 
it read like a script from the show - quite amusing - not sure what the 
desired reaction was - have you ever seen the show? An almost glutoness 
display of deep reflection - reveling in poetic prose - almost making me cringe."
</blockquote>

which made me think about the fact that i have so much i want to say, and 
often i have no one to say it to.  often my answers to questions i ask myself over and 
over again manifest themselves in my spewing my (stylized and cliched) guts out 
here.  
<br>
<br>
sometimes my thoughts and feelings are so big and unbearable that i pop, and this is one 
of the only places i feel comfortable enough to do so.  i've never been one 
for hiding (though i can be rather cryptic and vague at times) what's going on, though 
i do get in a lot less trouble revealing myself 
(however stylized or cliched) here.  
i'm a big fan of living life vicariously, and *this* is damn near perfect (for now).
