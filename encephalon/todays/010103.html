<p>i think i was in dallas a week too long but got to hang out with jason again at the library, 
with daddy at teppo and the go lounge, cory at johns, terillis (where i saw josh, little john and 
many many others) and the mall, duncan and <a href="http://www.lozenge.net" target="_blank">john</a> 
and a new coffee cup, 
daria at carlos' band the shells' show and again (along with everybody else) at deep sushi, sambuca 
and the new years eve party at the loft where i got mad kisses at midnight and ended up getting 
somewhat disappointed early in the morning, but no matter as the party 
was worth staying in town for, even through the sleet and snow but jen and i got my new 
furniture into the truck and her shit into the truck and got out of town for the almost 
thirty hour drive out here to san francisco, then beat as hell ate and crashed to wake up for 
a useless day at work and mad unpacking and now looking forward to making my new house my 
new home and to another incredible year with lessons in life from the hidden noise collective, 
lessons in love from daria; 

<!-- the conversation at sambuca; sigh.  she now knows, but now i know even less. -->

but the rest can be up to me.</p>
