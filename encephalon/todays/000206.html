i met a wonderful woman (through cory)  this weekend and was 
reminded of the person i want to be.  i hope i will become good 
friends with her.
<br><br>
i realized also how long it had been since i had met a woman (or 
anyone for that matter) who impressed me.  i'm not very easily 
impressed, but then again, it's been a long time since i've impressed 
myself.
<br><br>

<!-- 
i've also realized (again) how sick my friendship with cory is. 
another thing i love that is destroying me.
-->

dave and i spoke on the phone (which is fucked up, along with my 
stereo and car, not to mention my head!) this evening about our 
new furniture deal - hollingsworth design - and a possible new 
moonlighting gig.  i am excited.  i also 
spoke with <a href="http://www.snowball.com" target="_blank">
stephen</a>, which is always cool.  september can't get here soon 
enough.

<!-- ...because that's when i'm out of here! -->

<br><br>
i finally finished a rough draft of the coffee haus'
website (god i'm glad that's over with!).
<br><br>
i think my funk is on the upswing.  tomorrow morning, i'm going to 
<a href="000101.html">try again</a>.
