<!--   nme artist (prince), ampersand -->

working, finally, for an

awesome design studio</a> in soma.

they want me, but i'm too "expensive".  they might be sending me to one 
of their clients  though...

what a relief.
<br>
<br>
the traffic was too bad for me to sit through on the way home so i pulled into the 
mill valley depot for a cup of coffee and a cookie, 

<!-- i'm an addict -->

relaxation and some observation.  hippies, homeless, queens, yolanda's "children", 
everywhere, kicking hacky sacks.  terribly similar to the coffee haus, except 
of course for the intermitent breakdancing, and probably 40 degrees cooler...

god it feels good to be working!  it feels good to feel peaceful, and it feels 
good to feel at home.  i've come a long long way to get here.

<!-- 
the other night i saw a bird flapping in the parking lot of 
stephen's place, then when i went up to it to ask it if it 
was ok, it didn't move, not even when i tried to scare it - 
though it looked fine.  so i went in and called animal 
control and they directed me to the humane society who 
(i hope) came to pick it up.  

back in '97 i was waiting for 
a bus at the corner of lemmon and mckinney and this pick up 
stalled out making a horrible noise from the engine right in 
front of me and 3 mexicans got out, opened the hood, pulled 
out what was left of a torn to shreds but still alive cat by its 
tail, dropped it on the 
ground and drove off.  i cried until a cop came by and i 
told him to get someone to come and kill it.  then i got on my bus.
