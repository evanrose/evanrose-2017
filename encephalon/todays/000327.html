cory was right. 

<!-- he told me soul knew the *truth* -->

<br>
i had an ominous feeling all morning and it came to a head when i 
picked <a href="../stuff/mattandrebecca2.jpg" target="_blank">
her</a> (who was no longer blowing me off) up.  thankfully, i won't be 
perpetuating the same unhealthy patterns, at least for a minute.

<!-- and at least not with her, unfortunately, 
see yesterday's source code -->

so we had ice cream and had conversation that was an even bigger waste 
of time than before, 

<!-- 
i said "but damn!  i wanted to fuck you!", and she laughed.
i said "... and it'd be the best you'd ever had too." she didn't laugh.
-->

then i dropped her off and went to contemplate 
and reorganize over a cup of coffee.  over this cup of coffee i met 
an interesting and delightful swedish snowboarding/dancing/exchange 
student, and enjoyed the gay superbowl remembering an awesome 
and thought provoking conversation.  

<!-- and she was fine too!  here we go again (?) ... -->

recently i'd been thinking about email conversations (the original 
influence of the "cocktail party effect") and how they last for weeks 
(perhaps) but would only take up a few moments in real time.  i really 
think this completely changes the meaning and the imagined significance 
of said conversation.  deeper analysis by

thank god for good conversation, and communication in all its forms.

amon tobin</a> is putting out a single from his *upcoming record(!).  i 
believe he makes the best electronic music that's ever been made.
