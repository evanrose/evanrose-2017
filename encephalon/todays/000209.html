<!-- 
<a href="000117.html>she</a> told me the other night that she was getting 
tested because she'd had unprotected sex with a junkie.  i thought for a 
while about what this said about her, and then what it said about me 
("i'm dying inside").  i then went out and got a pack of cigarettes.

i've two great books in the past week: 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345361792/encephalon-20" target="_blank">a prayer for owen meany</a> 
(recommended by daria - even she doesn't realize how much it influenced her) 
and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316769509/encephalon-20" target="_blank">nine stories</a> 
by j.d. salinger.  the latter was astounding!  what 
an incredible writer!  i found his stories to be a lot like life, that is, 
horribly but appropriately anti-climactic; a style that i love and have 
tried to incorporate into some of my own 
<a href="../writing/laundry.html">writing</a>.
<br><br>
i told <a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">stephen</a> 
when i was <a href="vacation1199.html">out there</a> 
(s.f.) that it was all about the next right thing, and a constant 
reorganization of priorities. not only are my priorities (including wants, needs, 
and goals) not organized, i've lost sight of what they were in the first place; 
hence my state of mind for the past few months, and especially the 
past six weeks.
<br><br>
i'm thinking that if i do the next right thing long enough, the rest 
will fall into place.  i hope this is true, and i hope i can do the next right thing 
when it comes along.

<!-- 
its never been so hard though.  when i can't or won't see the concequences or 
rewards of my actions (whether taken or not), the action of doing next right 
thing (even for its own sake) becomes completely unimportant; so i don't do it.  
lack of faith?  simple self-destruction?  fucking stupidity?  i don't know.  
i just don't know.
