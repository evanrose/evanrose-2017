<p>coming home from the airport after dropping mom and marci off i was trying really hard to keep 
the car at 70 mph on that particular stretch of road, it was raining, it was a saturday night, cops were 
out and all that and was somewhat concerned that i might be driving too fast when a car passed 
at over 100 mph and startled me and i remembered back to the story i like to tell of having 
drunk a case and a half (that's 36 cans, or more) of budweiser and a pint bottle of tequila and a couple of 
wine coolers for dessert (after smoking pot all) day and then driving my girlfriend and best friend

in the pouring rain at 110 miles an hour chain smoking so i wouldn't pass out and spinning so 
badly that i couldn't close my eyes to kiss her goodnight or i would have thrown up 
and i was so grateful that i didn't kill anyone then or any of the other times i did similar things 
and then started thinking about how i didn't need to be anywhere that badly and about people who 
speed (like i sped that night) are acting out a deathwish and thank god that i have so much to 
live for today like my mom's trip to see me (my relationship with her) and looking for 
furniture (i have a place to live) and getting an email about a party (i have friends) and thinking 
about useful navigation and organization schemes for a website (i have and can keep a job) 
and countless other little things that would be so useless and unimportant if i had died and 
taken some people with me on a rainy night in '94 when i was seventeen years old.</p>
