i have officially been here for two months, and what a two months it has been!  i never 
dreamed so much could happen in such a short chunk of time, unbelievable. 
<br>
<br>
the past three days has been all about work, and i mean all about work.  working all 
day, then coming back and blazing through some crazy production.  bed at 4, up 
and back to the city early in the morning, bed at 4 again, etc; finally finished that silliness 
at one this morning.  now i'm enjoying my weekend (so far consisting of reading wired and drinking 
coffee) like i haven't enjoyed a weekend in a long time.
<br>
<br>
angela v. who i met through smu and who is now in boston working for 
<a href="http://www.sun.com" target="_blank">sun</a> just called to 
let me know she was in town, so we're going to try to hook up and eat dinner and 
dance tonight, but first i have 2 weeks worth of paperwork and bathroom cleaning to 
catch up on...

<br>
<br>

i gotta get ready for the next two months.

nicola emailed again, talking about being dissatisfied with her job and man - the 
most personal things i've heard from her in 5 years.  really rather odd.  i wrote 
her back and let her know about the little pang that i get in my stomach whenever 
i see an email from her.  i would really like to be a part of her life, if only 
virtually.  

i'm a fucking sicko.
