<p>i haven't set my alarm clock for a month, i've just gone to bed around 
midnight or so and have gotten up around 8 or so and have read and 
drunk coffee and have gotten to work around 10 but last night after cooking pasta and 
watching <a href="http://www.adcritic.com/content/movie-office-space-trailer.html" target="_blank">office space</a> 
(a damn good show), i finished the larkin suggested
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140231730/encephalon-20/104-2736877-9287905" target="_blank">the white hotel</a> and laid awake 
for the longest time thinking about the fantasies i conceive and letters i've written 
and loves from long ago and my dear friends and where and how we'll 
be when we meet again and fate and inevedabilities and where and how people 
who i haven't seen in a long time and what people who i'll one day 
know are doing right now and my upcoming plans and my long term goals and 
what they mean and the purpose of my attaining them and the children 
i might one day have with a woman who might or might not be out there somewhere 
and about being old and frail, unable to take care of myself and 
the generations who might follow me and about all those people in 
all those places who went through so much and had so little and died 
so unknown and peace and happiness and hope flowed over me and i 
was reminded (oh yes, once again) how anything is possible and oh my god 
life is so good and before i knew it, it was very late indeed and i 
woke up at damn near 10 and didn't roll in to the office until after 
11 and i believe that i'm going to go ahead and set my alarm tonight.</p>
