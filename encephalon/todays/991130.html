montreal was fabulous, 
<a href="http://members.theglobe.com/cheepacheepa/home.html" target="_blank">daria</a> 
was wonderful, a great time was had by all.  after going out dancing 
4 out of the five nights i was there, i have officially become a clubkid.  
oddly, (or not) i came home feeling sad after being reminded that things 
had not worked out like i had wanted them to (a long story), but there 
always seems to be more to life when
they don't.
</p>
<p>
i hit the ground running today, and shit seems to be blowing up all over 
the place, i.e. job offers,  
everybody's starting something, and everybody wants me to be a part of 
it, it feels great to be back in bidness, though thank heaven for this 
vacation.  good things 
are happening to everyone, which is wonderful too.
</p>
<p>
detailed accounts of my trip will be posted by thursday morning, 
but <a href="../writing/flight.html">here</a> is a new poem (yep,
 i'd been reading c.b. again).
