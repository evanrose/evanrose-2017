lots of work to do, and it feels so good.  
the day before yesterday had a meeting with 
jim of swerve records, pitching a site plan (when an index page up), 
as well as a maintainence plan.  at noon yesterday he placed an 
order for a flier to be picked up by three, and 
my first and only print work  
is what he got.  i, however, got paid!
<br><br>
i spelled it wrong, didn't i.  shit.
<br><br>
i just saw 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CXC7/encephalon-20" target="_blank">rear window</a> 
for the first time tonight, playing over at the 
inwood.  wonderful, though i couldn't help but be a bit disturbed 
that they seemed to totally not care that "ms. lonely heart" was going 
to kill herself; all because of their little obsession (that they 
were lucky enough to be correct about). it definitely touched a nerve 
with the whole <a href="000218.html">
web journal thing</a>.
