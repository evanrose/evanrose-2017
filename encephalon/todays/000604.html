instant messengers: friend or foe?  how odd that i should strike 
up a conversation with <a href="000212.html">renee</a> 

<!-- check out subsequent source codes -->

like it had been yesterday when we spoke last?  what about that 
medium (email included) that allows us to so easily swallow our 
pride and bear our souls, months after the time when we should 
have?
<br>
<br>
kind of irrelevant at this point.
<br>
<br>
Later on that night i shook my ass at 26 mix and then found myself 
at an after hours party up in the mission where i met a ton of 
cool (like the a.i. specialist/mit grad guy) people who live here, 
and even more who are on their way.  its nice feeling "in the groove". 
<br>
<br>
after working on 
<a href="http://www.havenco.com" target="_blank">this</a> 
and <a href="http://www.sealandgov.com" target="_blank">
this</a> all day yesterday (not to mention all week long this week), 
cory and amanda came into town.  we got up this morning for breakfast 
at the cafe, then down to the haight for window shopping and 
people watching (even saw robin williams at the mcdonalds!).
<br>
<br>
they're going to be leaving the day daria gets here.  weird, 
'cause i didn't ever see these people this often in dallas, but 
hey, i'd be visiting me out here too.
