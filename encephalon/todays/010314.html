<p>
after a most excellent weekend of hanging with evan and kiala, beverly's birthday 
party at <a href="http://www.amiraistanbul.com/" target="_blank">amira</a> 
(where we ate like kings and 
danced with the belly dancers(!) and met some cool people too), 111 minna 
to see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=music&field-keywords=%20%20recloose&bq=1/ref=aps_more_pm_1/105-0741733-4746340" target="_blank">recloose</a>,  an invitation to 
the whole crew to sneak into the rave at the moma (<a href="001010.html">cool</a> 
beyond description) and sunday's kicking it in the haight and a hamburger pie 
cooked at home, i got a dose of reality (for real) when geoff called to 
tell me about 3 guys coming to his place (the place that up until yesterday, my getting 
into had been priority number one) with a stolen key looking for dope, 
cash and guns, finding it/them, kicking 3 of his teeth out and bailing out - thank 
god leaving him and the young lady there alive, and as 
<a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">stephen</a> and i discussed 
for most of the evening yesterday, thank god they left them alive, and thank 
god he and i have left that sort of life, the sort of life where people are not 
to be trusted  and one's back must be watched at all times, behind and i'm thinking 
that a little patience and care is in order as i try to decentralize and become 
more fluid because i knew that shit like that as well as the not knowing 
and even slight discomfort that i've dealt with is what inspired me to 
get a safe place by my safe self in a safe town in a pretty safe part of the world - 
my saving and investing a little less each month (because my rent is so 
goddamned expensive) is a hell of a lot better than a gun being poked in my face and 
i'm all the more grateful for my quiet (saw 
<a href="http://www.cinemaniacscorner.com/trois.html" target="_blank">white</a> 
tonight, interesting and thought provoking; seeing red next tuesday) boring 
(an interesting therapy session with a coworker 

<!-- when she mentioned her boyfriend and his jealousy of me because "he hears 
alot about you, and the possibility of mutual attraction... -->

as well as a conversation with stephen about a new big web project and shows... on 
second thought, its not that boring) life.
