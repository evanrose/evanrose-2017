the cell sucked, but it was really nice getting out of house and seeing a movie, alone 
no less, and i don't think i'd ever done that before - totally looking forward to doing 
it again, but in the meantime after finishing up work on a 
<a href="http://inthehead.com/product/web/sites/laureladvisors2/index.html" target="_blank">new site proposal</a> 
for laurel advisors (not to mention updating <a href="http://www.inthehead.com" target="_blank">in the head</a> 
and my <a href="http://www.inthehead.com/people/resume.html" target="_blank">resume</a>) i decided at the last 
moment that i really would go out and see 
<a href="http://www.skinny.com/music/reviews/1999/10/html/recloose.html" target="_blank">dj recloose</a> at 
<a href="http://www.26mix.com" target="_blank">26 mix</a>, and i was gonna shake my 
ass until i couldn't shake it anymore, and that i did and it was awesome and i'm really 
hoping i can keep up the habit of doing things by myself, as i used to be all about 
solitude - i think its easy to be all about solitude when there are a host of people to call 
when one is ready to do so, i'm finding out here that when i've had enough solitude, there's 
no one to call, and my feeling great about being where i am turns into mindnumbing boredom and 
loneliness, which of course feeds on itself driving me to the point where i don't want to 
do anything but sleep (knowing in my heart of hearts that it'll just "get better"), but 
enough of that(!), i went out and had a great time and got all my drinks (including 
the one i bought for the guy who i cut in front of) for free, came home sore and sweaty as 
hell and looking forward to doing that again 
(except for the part about getting pulled over - again, for speeding, again, but this time i 
was without my new insurance and registration and liscence plates as well but also this time 
i got let off with a warning...) and i woke up this morning 
and waded through the semi bad vibes over here and rolled to enjoy some of my sunday 
with a <a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">friend</a> and it was all good.
