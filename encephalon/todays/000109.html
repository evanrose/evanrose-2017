oh the women.  i'm listening to 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002HK2/encephalon-20" target="_blank">emperor tomato ketchup</a>, 
thinking of 
<a href="../writing/you.html">d</a>- she's never too far away.  
spoke to daria for quite a while this evening, about lonely fucked-upedness.  poor girl.  we  
are so much alike.  there seems to be a certain group of people (really very smart and cool 
people) who know what they need, but are forever holding out for something thereby missing out 
on so much.  i'm one of these i'm afraid.  after speaking to daria though, i feel less alone 
and aimless, and feel that much better about her as a person.  pain is the touchstone of 
growth.  this too shall pass.  all that shit.<br>
i've been checking out richard's 
source code, and i think this fulfilled curiosity helps as well.  it gets me 
out of myself for a minute.
<br>
<br>
two 'friends' were supposed to stop by tonight.  niether came, and its ok.<br><br>
by the way, updates in aural</a>, 
and a little something for <a href="http://www.inthehead.com/" target="_blank">in the head</a> 
is in the works.  stay tuned!
