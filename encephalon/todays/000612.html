hello and welcome to an evening of costantly shifting moods and feelings!
<br>
<br>
after the haight street fair, the big kahoona (which sucked), and a picnic dinner 
looking over the bay in sausalito (not to mention an excellent 
<a href="../stuff/recipe.html">picnic recipe</a>!) i saw daria off back to dallas.  
i had a wonderful weekend and was missing her even before she left.
<br>
<br>
i've had to say goodbye to that girl entirely too many times.

<br>
<br>
she hasn't been the only girl i've watched fly away... when <a href="../writing/beginning.html">
nicola</a> left just after new years of '94 i remember how big a void she left here.  it 
wasn't quite like that this time, as circumstances were unbelievably different then, 
but i've been left feeling a bit lonely and sentimental today.
<br>
<br>
in *different* news, i think i figured it all out today (and i mean all of it, too) but its a little 
too long and boring to go into here.  knowing now, like i do, what its all about 
hasn't brought the peace and understanding i was expecting. instead i'm feeling anxious 
about the mission i'm supposed to be carrying out here on earth...
<br>
<br>
then a very nice boy at the coffee shop complemented me on my "perfect shirt, and perfect 
hair (!)", and i got to thinking there was hope for me yet.
