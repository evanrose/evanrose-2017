<a href="http://www.insite.net" target="_blank">insite</a> is a no go 
at the mo'; i'm glad i'm good at getting jobs.  

<!-- preston center antique mall - day 3.  i have to wear a tie -->

my thought process at the moment is saying "if i can't do what i want 
work-wise, what am i doing here?  if i can't have one job that does it 
i should sink myself into an oblivion of work for the next few years, 
sequester myself and push forward."  this is what i do anyway, as 
nothing is so important.  nothing has changed.  i'm still a bit 
perplexed - probably because my self esteem is so high!

<br>
<br>
i'm back to square one.  i don't feel regression.

<!-- but wait 'til i lose my car, my place, my stuff, my girls, 
my friends...-->

<br>
<br>
i think all of this is a problem, but i feel so good (not about my 
life, just in general) that i don't feel a pressing need to do anything 
about the problem; which may be the whole problem.  thank god there 
are people in my life 

<!-- thanks guys -->

that have been through this sort of thing before. 
even i've been through this before.
<br>
<br>
i should write down the solution i use this time for the next time, 
except the solution has always been and always will be the same.

<!-- 
keep working, keep communicating, keep doing the next right thing, 
and this too shall pass.
