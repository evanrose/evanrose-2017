<p>hanging with shila at steps of rome and city lights and hanging with my classmates 
after biology lab and hanging with 
<a href="../stuff/jason.html" target="_blank">jason</a> and missing the 
<a href="http://www.ninjatune.net/coldcut/error.html" target="_blank">coldcut</a> show 
and shooting pool in san rafael and staying at the palomar and eating breakfast and shopping 
at old navy(!) and throwing the football in mill valley and shooting pool in san 
rafeal again and bar hopping with jason the way back to his hotel and 
breakfast with <a href="http://www.peterme.com" target="_blank">peter</a> and hanging 
with her *again* at the little cup and getting the plastic castle was a 
whole lot of fun and now to study (for two biology tests) and work on cgi stuff 
and grapple with the fact that 
<a href="http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/artists/clifford_gilberto/" target="_blank">clifford gilberto</a> 
might as well be <a href="http://www.hi-res.net" target="_blank">hi-res!</a> and
