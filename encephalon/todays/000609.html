i think i have too much work to do, and that's a problem, yet i think my problem is 
that i think i have too much work to do.  during a beautiful day, a breakfast with 
friends, the moma, and a sushi dinner at benihana's, i'm continuously thinking of 
what needs to be done.  maybe i'm just trippin'.  i'm definately trippin'.
<br>
<br>
on a lighter note, i got some great vinyl today: 2 U2 joshua tree singles, one 
of eno's ambient works (vol. 4), trainspotting soundtrack, and anthrax' "i'm the 
man".  
<br>
<br>
the conversations and little things i see and the thoughts i've had lately have been 
utterly amazing and full of wonderful possibility.  i just don't remember 
them very long.  whatever.
<br>
<br>
yeah, whatever.  kinda sums it all up there doens't it?  nihilistic maybe, but 
even naming it gives it too much importance.  it is very interesting though, maybe 
even kinda cool.

daria told me "i don't want you to meet him" (her "boyfriend" mark).  she said 
she was afraid i wouldn't like him.  as well as i know that "i'm the better man", 
i couldn't help but think of when <a href="/writing/theletter.html">someone</a> 
told me they "didn't want me to meet him" and i got sick to my stomach.
maybe <a href="/writing/theletter.html">she</a> said he didn't want to meet me.
it doesn't matter; nothing has changed.

yeah, its cool.
