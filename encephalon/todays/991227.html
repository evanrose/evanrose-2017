i've had a long weekend, 3 days so far, then tomorrow off as well.  
0i almost don't know what to do with 
myself!  its been so nice seeing friends that have been away... 
a show with matt, earl harvin last week with
 daria, upcoming date(ish sort of thing) with renee; 
i'm not getting much work (new site next week!) done, but damn 
i'm having a good time!
</p>
<p>
the new year is rapidly approaching (its so weird seeing those 
millenium clocks' numbers so low...) 
and i'm gearing up... fantasizing about what all i'm going to do.  
furniture?  a coffee shop with dave?
 building web sites for folks?  a movie?  school?  move to 
san francisco?  join a band?  excercise?  quit smoking?  
isolate?  get a new job?  make a record?  in one year?!?  
maybe.  its exciting.
</p>
<p>
doing more=being more.
