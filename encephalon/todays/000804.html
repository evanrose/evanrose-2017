like i was saying, hi-res hooked it up over at 
<a href="http://www.ntone.com" target="_blank">ntone</a>.
<br>
<br>
i've had dissatisfaction on my mind this week - i believe that i've 
been really unhappy with my living situation, and its beginning to take its 
toll.  my roomates, however laid back and unobtrusive, are just plain 
depressing - rebecca hiding in her room and noah playing video games.  
every night.  
living out in the boondocks doesn't help either.  i spend 
alot of time thinking about architecture and furniture design, which is 
leading me in the direction of really 
<a href="000711.html">wanting a space of my own</a> which is 
making this situation all the more disagreeable.  i *am* saving lots of 
money here, and not knowing very many people (i.e. being marooned) is 
allowing me to get alot done and learned... i guess i'm just going through 
"post adjustment" adjustment.  
<br>
<br>
i'm also trying really hard to remember how i got "back into life" 
<a href="000318.html">five years ago</a>, and then again 2.5 years ago; 
then reminding myself that if i want certain things to happen, 
*i've* got to make them happen.  
<br>
<br>
its a work in progress, as usual.  and rather redundant i might add.
<br>
<br>
last night was dope though... got together with the crew to check out 
<a href="http://www.nbjazzfest.org/forward.html" target="_blank">jazz forward</a> 
(don't forget greg dumping his drink on the keyboard player when we 
got evicted from our spot - and my working the door for the second half of 
the evening); shook my ass, saw some pretty people, very nice.  even 
nicer was our discussing jetting to london to check out 
<a href="http://www.warprecords.com/warp/news/contents.html#tourdates" target="_blank">
The Incredible Warp Lighthouse Party</a>.  even nicer than that?  i think 
we're really gonna go.
<br>
<br>
but first, i've got some flash work and client work, some book shopping, then 
a day on haight street planned for this weekend - and so the funk was lifted.
