<p>so, you know, i'm a mood swinding kind of guy, like i'm up one minute and down the 
next and i think too much and i write and try to sound deep and connected and in touch 
with the pain yet at the same time exhibit the "joy of being" that i really do have (and 
not worry my mother too much), but you know its been a damn good week and i did some 
really cool 
<a href="http://www.zoza.com/shop/shop_context.jhtml?CTXTID=1126&DIVID=100" target="_blank">java hacking and dhtml/javascripting</a> 
(to set the # of # and the previous/next thing, as well as the M and W being 
reversed depending on whether one was looking at the men's or women's side) 
that took up my whole week and left 
me very very satisfied with my job and my career and my relation to it (and in relation 
to my age and level of experience) and about most things in general and its funny 
how such a little success can totally whip my attitude into shape, but this is nothing 
new as there have never been jobs more satisfying than working the front door at 
<a href="http://www.terillisdfw.com/" target="_blank">terilli's</a> and 
at the <a href="http://www.guidelive.com/features/coffeebreak/" target="_blank">coffee haus</a>
 - high stress, lots of communication, lots of brain power expenditure, 
worthwhile and immediate results/gratification - just like it was nice to be

"superstar of the day 'award' superstar" three days in a row, you know how it is and 
i've gotten my free tv from geoff and have hooked up my doesn't eat tapes anymore vcr 
and have watched heat (love that machine gun battle!) and apollo 13 (which i had never 
seen before and was less than thrilled about) and and after last night and being 
out until 6am seeing

<a href="http://www.theendup.com/" target="_blank">endup</a> - and hanging out with 
a delightful indian girl from hong kong (who was a pre-med with an english accent!), 
a little bit of emergency preparation at the 
<a href="http://www.zoza.com/zine/zine_walkin.jhtml" target="_blank">zoza store</a> and doing some studying today, 
i'm set to enjoy this saturday evening at home, alone with sex, lies and videotape and
