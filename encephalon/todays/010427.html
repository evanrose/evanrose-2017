work and school and spinning records and shows 
(<a href="http://www.billynayer.com/" target="_blank">billy nayer show, the american astronaut</a>, 
<a href="http://www.tinocorp.com/news.html" target="_blank">tino corp</a>, 
single cell orchestra, the bored collective) and really interesting plans... but 
<!-- dinner with chris at smallpondstudios.com next week -->

haven't been able to write lately - i can only pour out so much and most of what 
i've been pouring out (read: shoveling - heh) has gone into crafting replies 
to emails in an obsessive and masturbatory fashion - for good reason of course 
but as we've discussed - its based on emotion that is difficult and destructive to 
hold onto and stay close to for too long so now i'm updating at work but 
being interupted by walks and changing of cds and have an hour and a 
half until i leave to begin phase two of a certain(ly) interesting and 
definitely exciting journey(? experiment? dunno - don't matter) and all of 
the pontificating and analyzing (as well as emailing) has become unnecessary as its all really 
very simple and a weekend of 3 of my favorite things 

<!-- smoking, talking and fucking --> 

is what its all about and the rest will come and get done in good time.
