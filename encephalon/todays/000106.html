i finally had my freakout, night before last: screaming, beating the shit 
out of my bathroom door, sobbing, then a nap.  day five is much better.  
micah and i had dinner last night at snuffers, my first burger in a looong time,
 and discussed our upcoming meeting with almaroe about building a site for the 
coffee haus.  we had gone out to see james porter play, but that didn't happen.
  i registered for school yesterday too.  physics and algebra, as well as a 
two day flash course, so we're stuck with this site until then...
