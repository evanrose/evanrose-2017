my thoughts and feelings have been way beyond my control lately, and my dealings 
with people have been adversely affected, unfortunately, because it's people that 
have helped me through the past couple of weeks (thank you lord for those people).
<br><br>
after a couple of weeks' worth of drama (that's been between my ears mostly...), 
things are back on track.  not the right track, but a track nonetheless.  
my faith is really strong right now, thanfully; it's what's helping me not need 
the things i think i need.  
<br><br>
it snowed this past week.  the coffee haus' website is coming along.  i'm thinking 
about traveling.  i've been having really good conversations lately.  i'm maintaining.
i haven't had a cigarette in 29 days.
