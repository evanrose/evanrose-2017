<p>
re-entry; interesting, thought provoking, sanity questioning, deep thinking, plan making, 
excitement that's easy to talk and write about when i'm not in it - it feels like forever 
(and sounds like too, doesn't it?) when i'm all up in it but i digress because i am 
here and did not burn up - too much - and have already 
said that it is natural - the inevetable come down from (oh so) intense highs - centered 
is... good and centered and speaking to stephen for an hour and a half this evening 
about our respective psyches (in more ways than one) and our upcoming couple of months, 
him hearing about the sacred inbetweenus between her and me 
(which is in between him and me also) and excitement 
and hope for the unknown that we are both entering alone in his way and me in mine 
and together as we discussed our desires and dreams for our 
<a href="http://www.undertheradar.net/" target="_blank">dj gig</a> and 
our crews' consolodation of portfolio and 
the places we'd like to go and the things we'd like to do and he quoted me: 
"right now is it, no past, no future - this is it" which was most appropriate and 
is appropriate to every (and especially to this) situation, the 
ones that were, the ones that are and the ones 
that will (oh my god i can't wait for them to) be and all these conversations falling 
in line with each other reminds me that i was *already* on a certain road, a road 
of building and creating and exploring the work that a 
group of people who respected and loved each other could push 
out into the world, when others' roads began converging with mine - 
and the beauty the life/art/work/god that revealed it self in our building in our creation 
was always there and for all situations, with all of us and we "have been rendered devoid 
of choice, if we try to be rational, we can't, its not rational - its a gift that" is freely 
given that takes us places we could never go alone.
