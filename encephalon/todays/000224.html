i finished the final draft of my 
	<a href="http://www.inthehead.com/resume" target="_blank">
resume
	</a>, 
which looks really good, surprisingly enough, but before i even finished, i got an interview 
with 	<a href="http://www.insite.net" target="_blank">
insite productions
	</a>.  
just in time too;  i thought i could chill, but i can't.
<br><br>
browsing through files for this site has led me to the conclusion that i am missing 
lots and lots of files.  midi and jpg files, whole sites even.  i'm glad i still 
have a copy of this 
	<a href="../stuff/evanrose.jpg" onMouseover="window.status='wink wink'; return true" target="_blank">
picture
	</a> 
(thank god i was a boy scout and made sure i was prepared!).  i've been wondering why 
there are so many midi files "not found" in my status report, and speaking of status, 
i got a hit from 
	<a href="http://members.theglobe.com/cheepacheepa/home.html" target="_blank">
daria's "site"
	</a> 
recently.  how cool is that?
