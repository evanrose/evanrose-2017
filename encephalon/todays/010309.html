after seeing a whole bunch of movies (crouching tiger hidden dragon, land without bread, 
la jett&eacute;, polanski's 2 men and a wardrobe, and dali's un chien andelou, and 
<a href="http://www.cinemaniacscorner.com/trois.html" target="_blank">bleu</a> [seeing 
blanc and rouge on the next two tuesdays at the red vic]) and buying a whole 
bunch of records and going out every night this week i'm thinking i'm finally gonna 
get to get my programming on but took a french test and cooked and wrote a long 
letter and now am finishing up laundry and am out of smokes and damn i'm tired

and <a href="000817.html">evan d</a> is flying in for week and oakenfold and

<a href="http://www.zeldman.com/glamorous/glamorous35.html" target="_blank">special, jeffrey</a>?  you gotta 
take it while you can get it) as well as an interview for some offsite web work 
next wednesday then mom's coming in town and then amon tobin 
and my upcoming <a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">dj gig</a> and so on 
and so forth and life and busy-ness and seeing as how i won't be getting anything done 
anytime soon i'm really glad that the letter that i replied to this evening even though the 
return address is now defunct(?) came today and that i was able to take some time out 
to read and write and (briefly) remember and (continue to) dream.
