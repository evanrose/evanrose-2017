a finished 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0747549923/encephalon-20/104-2736877-9287905" target="_blank">last exit to brooklyn</a>, 
a fantasy about calling shaila 
and telling her i've finished it over coffee, a beautiful bus ride, delays, 
finishing harmony korine's 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385485883/encephalon-20/104-2736877-9287905" target="_blank">crackup at the race riots</a>, a horrible 
scary flight, a ride from cory and colin, coffee at the coffee haus, tyler, a 6pm meeting and 
people who haven't been seen in a long time, a dinner with larkin at the 
cafe ismir deli, conversation at the 
new amsterdam, and more with 
<a href="http://www.lozenge.net" target="_blank">john</a> and discussions of his needing 
a job and the possibilities of industrial space in oakland or a little house in berkeley, 
<a href="http://www.w00zy.com" target="_blank">a new friend</a>, another conversation with cory and 
with lydia who told me of my old friend's death of a heroin overdose last fall
and everything that implied, 
a ride to and some drama at cafe brazil, a nova special on the myans, a chicken fried steak for 
breakfast at lucky's, a bit of time with daddy and then a bit of 
time with mom and a subsequent dinner at the worlds' 
best bbq joint, a coffee at the coffee haus again where gratitude and hope was 
expressed to the new owner who knew so much more about me than i did of her, tucker, jason b., 
hilary, kevin hanlon and kenyan, 
the bar of soap to see todd and 
the boozers, the loft and seeing michael, charlie, tracy, and 
staying up and a beautiful connection with d (and thankfully changing the connotation that 
letter has held for so long), waking up two hours later for a breakfast at john's, then of 
course, <a href="000221.html">terilli's</a> and that whole crew, northpark for new shoes, telephone conversations 
with don and frank, a pizza at ez's, picking up michael, a movie with cory 
as the serial killer premiering at the <a href="http://www.dm-art.org/" target="_blank">dma</a>, 
coffee with mom, a going away party at new amsterdam with everybody and 
<a href="http://www.angstromgallery.com" target="_blank">more</a> 
the love at the table that was absolutely 
remarkable, a return to the loft for another long conversation and another 
invitation to stay and another beautiful night, 
another missed flight and not being surprised and eating at the angry dog with everyone instead, goodbyes, 
<a href="http://www.goodrecords.com" target="_blank">good records</a>, 
the coffee haus, a dinner with mom and conversations of dominatrixi and foot rubs, a ride 
to the airport and more delays, an hour circling san franscisco, a shared $67 cab ride, 
a little sleep, a normal day at work, a test, a meal, a chat about my trip 
and the emotional residue left over, a discovery that both 
of my websites are down, 
a shrug, a good nights sleep.
