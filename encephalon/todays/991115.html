maybe its just me, but i find it strange how the women i talk to, whether good friend or not, 
sooner or later inform me of their relationship status, i assume to let me know if i should
proceed/retreat.  in the context of a conversation, this is odd because i certainly don't ask (usually
because i don't care one way or the other).  oddly enough, there was one who i wish had clued 
me in earlier.  she didn't because she was aware of and disliked this phenomena, therefore kept the information to 
herself.  thankfully it was revealed before i made an ass out of myself.

in other news, a story i wrote has been published at <a href="http://www.ember.org" target="_blank">
ember.org</a>.  check it out.  also, <a href="http://www.edanz.com" target="_blank">edanz.com</a> 
(the company i work for) has finally launched.  dig those jams in each of the "dance worlds"!<br>
i'll be seeing you (hopefully) at the <a href="http://www.stereolab.co.uk" target="_blank">stereolab</a> 
show tomorrow night.
