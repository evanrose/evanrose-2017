i just couldn't bring myself to go out tonight and as a result i'm missing (from what i 
heard from beverly) a dope ass opening but after coffee and target to get an airmattress for 
mom and grocery shopping and making it home at almost 9pm the thought of driving back 
to the city to go to a gathering by myself just doesn't strike me as something i should do 
but goddamn i wish i could sometimes and i can't believe that i'd rather stay home what with 
all the drama that's gone on with noah and this breaking the lease thing and even 
monique saying "i don't want to see evan socially" like i ever gave anything for that bitch 
(but that doesn't stop me from being pissed at hearing something like that)  
but this thing blew up into a huge illogical stupid mess so quickly and everything will be 
much better when i make it to 
<a href="http://www.gomillvalley.com" target="_blank">mill valley</a>; right over the bridge 
into the city, not dealing with traffic, 
<a href="000711.html">building some furniture</a>(!) and i am so ready to go and i woke up this morning thinking about 
one year ago today when i woke up on cory's sofa "smelling london" and already regretting the fact 
that i <a href="http://www.edanz.com" target="_blank">sold out</a> and gave up my trip to europe, 
but i got <a href="http://www.minuteman.vwdealer.com/vwapoview.epl?extend=36027955&photo_id=4262287&make=Volkswagen&model=Jetta&year=1997" target="_blank">my car</a> 
and my wonderful old apartment that same day and this has been a pretty 
exceptional year - in retrospect - and i think that if i'd gone and done what i was 
planning on doing, that i wouldn't be here and like someone said: "we live in the 
most probable of all possible worlds" and i guess my staying in dallas and 
<a href="http://www.inthehead.com" target="_blank">doing my thing</a> then coming out here 
and on up to my "screwing" my roomates and sitting at home tonight (until i get out 
to go see the cell here in a bit) was all meant to be, and hopefully it will continue 
to be so.
