thanks <a href="../stuff/john.html" target="_blank">john</a>...
<br><br>
happy leap year day.  after a weekend of blissful laziness, my week 
has been and hopefully will continue to be one of productiveness.  a 
meeting with a client yesterday, a total site design (navigation, look, 
*and* feel), and another meeting today.  also fixed broken links and 
did some general maintainence on this site in every section.
<br><br>
for now though, i'm enjoying 
my unemployed (read freelancing) morning routine: waking up without the 
alarm, sitting in my recliner in my underwear, my laptop in my lap, 
drinking 2 pots of coffee (4 cups), smoking cigarettes; its like 
heaven!
<br><br>
i've been fantasizing about 
<a href="http://www.sprintpcs.com/learn/show_phone.asp?sku=NPK100101" target="_blank">
this phone</a> all weekend.  i certainly don't need it, 
but god i want it!
<br><br>
i've been racking my brain trying to come up with a word or email 
address to do with communication/email/contact/"information" that 
starts with a *p*.  all i can come up with is "protocol@....com, or 
possibly "production@....com".  i'd really like a word; a synonym 
for contact "p"referably.  
<a href="../contact/index.html">
help!</a>
