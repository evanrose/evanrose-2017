<!-- begin entry -->

every morning, i sit and drink my coffee and look at all of the 
regularly updated sites in my bookmarks, and it seems as though i'm 
able to find interesting and useful content less and less as time goes 
on.  everyone name dropping and 
<a href="#">linking</a> between cryptic vagueness (which i love, just 
not so early in the morning).  thank you for 
your weblog <a href="http://ampersand.pitas.com/" target="_blank">
richard</a>.  no bullshit, just descriptions (a major plus) and links. 
<br><br>
the <a href="000218.html">cocktail party effect</a> in one of its many forms.  
i should write a book about it.

<!-- though i'm probably too late for that... -->


<br><br>
work work work!  coffee haus 
has given the go ahead on their site (though i just received a 
different *background* to work with- shit!), working on 
<a href="http://www.the5k.org/" target="_blank">5k</a> version 
2.0, and thinking of extremely ugly and experimental redesigns to 
this site.  oh yeah, and math too.  

<br><br>
i talked to <a href="http://www.undertheradar.net" target="_blank">
stephen</a> last night, and discussed his coming to town in a few 
weeks (he left and i didn't think he'd ever be back).  i can't wait!  
he is a tornado of good vibes and creativity, 
and spending time with him is not only exciting, its extremely 
refreshing as well.  

<!-- 
and he's still trying to get me to move out there (s.f.) though 
he doesn't have to try too hard these days.  

god i'm so ready to go.

<br>
<br>
it'd be nice to breathe some life back into life.

<!-- 
'98 was all about stephen and daria, two of my dearest friends and two 
of the most amazing people i've ever met.  it makes me wonder what my 
thinking was then to attract such people as friends, and looking at 
where they are now, s.f. and mcgill in montreal, it makes me wonder 
what's going on with my thinking now.
