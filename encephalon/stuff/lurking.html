"absoulutely.  <i>lurk</i> is the cognitive apprenticeship term for 
legitimate peripheral participation.  the culture of the internet 
allows you to link, lurk, and learn.  once you lurk you can pick up 
the genre of that community, and you can move from the periphery to 
the center safely asking a question - sometimes more safely virtually 
than physically - and then back out again.  it has provided a platform 
for perhaps the most successful form of learning that civilization has 
ever seen.  we may now be in a position to really leverage the community
mind."
