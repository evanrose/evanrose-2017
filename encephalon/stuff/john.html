<br>
for a wonderful evening.  it didn't quite live up to my expectations, 
though, 
so i will not be going on a date with you again.  <br><br>
"why" you ask?<br><br>
<blockquote>
a. you told me you were going to buy me 2 sodas.  i didn't get 2 
sodas, i got no sodas.  <br>
b. you brought along your friend cory.<br>
c. you didn't even drive.<br>
d. you took me to a place that was closed, and then to the record store.
 oh wait, cory took me.  (see c.)    
oh wait, i wanted to go to the record store.<br>
c2. cory and i dropped you off at your car so cory could take me home!!!
<br>
e. you haven't called me "in the morning".<br>
(i'm still waiting...)
<br>
f. you're not female; i tried to look past that, but i can't.<br>
you're such a good friend, why don't we leave it at that?  

</blockquote>
<br>
<a href="../contact/index.html">email me.</a> i don't have your 
address.<br>
in all seriousness, it was good to see you.  you can call and take me 
out anytime.
