5.5 years ago, one of my dearest friends, jason s., now aged 21, invited me to stay at his 
home after i'd gotten kicked out of my fathers house in las vegas for doing drugs. 
his parents, of course, had the final say (as we were pretty young 5.5 years ago, 
and still are now).  i lived with them for 2 months until i was asked to leave, 
again, for doing drugs.  unfortunately, back then, none of us, myself, jason, and 
his parents were doing very well.  
<br>
<br>
5 years later, the last time i saw his mother, we had dinner and i heard about 
her job and about how his dad's business was doing, and they heard about 
my plans to move and how well i was doing.  we congratulated each other and ourselves 
on how far we'd come and what we'd come through to get there.  it was wonderful.
<br>
<br>
jason's mom died on june 3 at the age of 49.  that's why this page is black.
