they changed my shower head yesterday, and i had a horrible shower.  
i then went on to have a not so great day.<br>
i wonder why my week's been "not so great"?<br>

<!--
i had a dream last night where <a href="000117.html">she</a> 
asked me to stay the weekend.  it's amazing how dreams can affect 
my mood.<br>
daria and i also both started smoking in this dream...
-->

my shower today was alright.<br><br>
my day seems to be going alright too.
