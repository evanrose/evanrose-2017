<p>Just in case you were wondering which Evan Rose I might be (as this question comes up relatively often), I thought I might tell you a bit about myself.</p>

<p>I was born in Dallas, Texas on July 6, 1977 to Charles and Leslie Rose.  I attended school at Lakemont Academy, St. Mark's Prepatory School, University Park Elementary School, McCulloch Middle School and Highland Park High School, a school I dropped out of just after starting my junior year.  As a kid, I rode my skateboard (until a major accident), rode my bike and listened to rock and roll.  As a teenager I did a lot of drugs and got in trouble.  After leaving home at 16 and spending a year on couches and the streets, I got clean and sober in March 1995.  I also had (and still have) the opportunity to do a great deal of traveling.  I've been to Europe many times, including a semester of college in Italy, and have visited the Middle East and Asia.</p>

<p>Before getting into computers, I worked at several restaurants and coffee shops; most notably Terilli's, The Barley House, Rock n' Java, and Coffee Haus, all in Dallas.  When I wasn't working any of these jobs, I was usually working a second job or going to school at Richland College.</p>

<p>In May 2000, I moved to San Francisco, California and worked for several different companies doing web development as well as putting on electronic music shows and DJing with <a href="http://www.stephenruiz.com">Stephen Ruiz</a> as a crew called Under the Radar.  I lived for a year in Mill Valley and a year in Oakland where I converted a space in an old wood mill into an apartment, I worked for Small Pond Studios, The Gap, ZoZa, LeapFrog and OneBody, andI went to school at The College of Marin and Laney Community College in Oakland.</p>

<p>In May 2002, I moved back to Texas and, with a friend, started <a href="http://bornagainfurniture.com/">a little Mid-Century Modern furniture business</a> before working for Apple Computer and starting an IT consultancy.  When I wasn't doing working, I played drums in a rock and roll band called Star Shooter (<a href="/work/music/starshooter/demo/">listen to some of our tracks here</a>), transfered as a Junior into the Architecture program at the University of Texas at Arlington, and spent six months living in Denton, about 45 minutes north of Dallas.</p>

<p>In June 2004, I moved to New York and after stints of working for Apple, MTV, and <a href="http://www.tekserve.com/">Tekserve</a> (not to mention <a href="/?section=work">freelance web development and consulting</a>) and living in Williamsburg, TriBeCa, and the Lower East Side, I again work for MTV Networks and live in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. I read a lot, take a lot of pictures (some of which I post <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/evanrose/">here</a>), study and think about personal finance and real estate, battle a shoe addiction, ride my motorcycle, and am trying to turn <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/evanrose/sets/72157594575869294/">house</a> into a home.</p>
