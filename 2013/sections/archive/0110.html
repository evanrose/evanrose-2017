<p>beijing, china, pusan, south korea, nagasaki and kagoshima japan, shanghai, wuxi and honk kong, china - a great trip, except for being intombed in a floating <a href="http://www.ncl.com/fleet/04/wind.htm">nursing home</a> for most of the time.  then, the longest weekend of my life: going to bed at 12:15am "yesterday", saturday the 27th, waking at 5:30 in hong kong, getting on a plane at 11:45, flying literally through the night, arriving in san francisco at 8:15am (on saturday the 27th) flying to and arriving in dallas at 5pm, going out with larkin and <a href="http://lozenge.net">john</a>, coming home and getting to bed at 11:45pm for a grand total of a 35.5 hour day.</p>
<p>today'll be a bit longer too - and hour extra for "falling back" and another 2 for flying to the west coast - damn its good to be back.</p>

<p>d and i were playing six degrees of kevin bacon after seeing <a href="http://rockstarmovie.warnerbros.com/">rock star</a> and realized that i suck at that game, so i came home and found on google something i just knew was out there - <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/oracle/">the oracle of bacon</a> - ain' the web grand?</p>
<p>found grooviness: <a href="http://www.onepointzero.com/">one.zero</a>, an interesting weblog and the beautiful <a href="http://www.blind.com/">blind.com</a></p>
<p>to the crew in dallas - i'll (hopefully - pray for peace) be there briefly this weekend on my way to china - <a href="#contact">email me for details</a>.</p>

<p>yesterday i began work on a new <a href="/dev/0110/">css based design</a> for this site with lots of help from owen brigg's <a href="http://www.thenoodleincident.com/tutorials/box_lesson/boxes.html">little boxes</a> (thank you) - i'd love to hear how it looks on your machine - <a href="#contact">let me know</a>.</p>
<p>my "weblog" got <a href="http://www.theweblogreview.com/review.php?id=502">reviewed</a>.  ouch - i think.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/oldhat.html">robert x. cringely's archived articles at pbs.org</a>, how to get dsl for free, we hate microsoft and lots lots more.</p>
<p>after thinking about it a bit - i could talk about my dreams of working in a coffee shop again and djing and going to school and playing with my websites full time and buying a new bmw, or my fears about my not being in a relatively new relationship and that the economy is going to hell and that i too will soon die in a plane crash, or perhaps i could speak of the metaphysical state of all things, interconnections, relations, dependancies and the fully connected whole depression i wake up with on sunday mornings... but <a href="http://encephalon.org/">i've done all that</a> and it wasn't very interesting either (or i could just try not to take things personally).</p>

<p>i use <a href="http://www.mapquest.com">mapquest</a> and other sites like it (most recently, <a href="http://www.moviefone.com">moviefone.com</a>) quite a bit, and though mapquest gets it right milage wise, i always laugh when i see a site telling me that x (my house or office in oakland) is only 10 miles or so from y (which might be mill valley, where i used to live) which is very true, except for the fact that the bay is in the way which makes the trip closer to 30 miles.</p>
<p>i remember studying this issue in a college government class taught by a centrist teacher and agreed at the time that the seperation of church and state was necessary, but that they don't need to be hostile of one another - the <a href="http://www.lava.net/~hcssc/">hawaii citizens for the separation of state and church</a> manifesto(?) as well as the events of late have driven home exactly why a "wall" between them is so important.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.carboniq.com">carbon iq</a> and <a href="http://www.smallpondstudios.com">small pond studios</a> are having a <a href="http://www.carboniq.com/log/archives/00000097.html">brown bag discussion</a> on the <a href="http://www.leapfrog.com">leapfrog.com</a> project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zoolander.com/">zoolander</a> is a hilarious movie - i like ben stiller more and more with every film of his i see - but it was very interesting seeing a movie filmed in and based in new york and *not* seeing the world trade center towers at all (apparently they went back in and digitally removed them).</p>
