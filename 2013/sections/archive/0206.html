<p>Speaking of emails, got an email from <a href="http://web-graphics.com">Nate</a> wondering what the hell was going on with me and calling me out on my stupid mistake when I edited my DNS info for my other sites, redirecting them to my <a href="http://he.net">hosting provider's home page</a>.  For those in the know who also care, all one of you, mac.evanrose.com, dev.evanrose.com, and encephalon.org, my other beloved little sites will be living as memories in your head(s?) until I'm once again able to run a server farm out of my house.  In the meantime, requests for said sub and top level domains will justify to this page right here.</p>
<p>Got a very nice email from David over at the <a href="http://netwert.com/ideapad/">IdeaPad</a> about my previous comments on about his site.  I replied in kind.  I'm very much looking forward to his upcoming redesign.</p>
<p>There is an eclipse <a href="http://www.space.com/spacewatch/eclipse_2002_020520.html">coming up</a> on the 10th, but first, the Earl Harvin Trio on Thursday night.  Speaking of trios, don't tell anyone, but the Shelley Carrol Trio is now playing every monday night at the New Amsterdam right here in Big D.</p>

<p>As of almost two weeks ago, I made it to Dallas safe and sound, and have been basking in the glow of friends and free time ever since.  <a href="http://www.thepolyphonicspree.com/">The Pollyphonic Spree</a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0157583">Enigma</a> have been interesting diversions from all the coffee drinking and conversations.  I'm still trying to catch up on email and web-surfing (finally have my machine connected to the net), but have just found myself too busy lately.</p>
