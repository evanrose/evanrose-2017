<p>It seems I may have a pretty close solution for what Anil is asking for <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/004904.php">here</a>, without all of the hassle of learning XSLT (or without the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> people having to create such functionality); it's called a web browser, and from what I can tell, it works pretty well ;)</p>
<p><a href="http://web-graphics.com">Nate</a> comes through with some RSS resources: <a href="http://www.webreference.com/authoring/languages/xml/rss/">RSS articles at WebReference</a> and <a href="http://usefulinc.com/rss/rsswriter/">RSSWriter</a> a PHP to RSS class.  Cool.</p>
<p>Tonight I meant to put up my old journal site, encephalon.org, but got bogged down dealing with accounts at <a href="http://netsol.com">Network Solutions</a> and <a href="http://zoneedit.com">Zone Edit</a> (a self serve DNS site) that I couldn't remember the usernames or passwords to.  What an unbelievable pain in the ass.</p>

<p>Speaking of tabs - I am having some major problems with Mozilla these days - sucking up memory, crashing, being a pain in the ass in general.  I typically open up tons of windows, several with tons of tabs, and this eventually gets a spinning beach ball that just never goes away, with up to 90% cpu usage.  It seems like the parsing and display of HTML shouldn't be such a big problem - it is a browser after all...</p> 
<p>And speaking of Safari - <a href="http://www.apple.com/applescript/safari/">here are some AppleScripts for Safari</a> over at apple.com.  Also at the apple site: <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=75459">every keyboard shortcut they could find</a>.</p>
<p>I've gotten way into <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">daring fireball</a> and am currently working my way through its archives.  Very very good stuff.  It seems as though he had <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2002/09/feed_me.html">the exact same thing to say</a> about <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> as I just have.</p>

<p>Dave Hyatt <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/archives/2003_01.html#002275">seems to have quite a sense of humor</a> about his product, and rightly so - safari is an awesome browser.  We ain't gonna be laughing for long if we don't get our tabs, though...</p>
<p>Over at XLab, I've found a whole mess of <a href="http://www.xlab.co.uk/macosx/apps.php">OS X applications</a> and another whole mess of <a href="http://www.xlab.co.uk/macosx/articles.php">articles and tutorials</a>.  Speaking of articles and tutorials: <a href="http://www.michaelandrochellessite.com/about/michael/blog/193">seven articles on one man's upgrade to Jaguar</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/004843.php">Anil got a new laptop</a>, and almost seems apologetic that it's not an Apple.</p> 
<p>Another great thing about RSS (really and truly, I haven't been so excited about anything in a long time) is that I've been able to start reading sites I used to read but then stopped for whatever reason (like <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/">Anil's</a>) and start reading ones I'd never have had time for in the past.  Everyone else seems really excited about it too: <a href="http://www.michaelandrochellessite.com/about/michael/blog/248">Making news aggregators easy</a>, <a href="http://www.textuality.com/rss/RssFutures.html">Where Next for RSS?</a>, and <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/news/xml/index">whole mess of feeds at Computerworld</a>. I asked <a href="http://www.monokromatik.com/veethree/">Brian</a> what he thought about it and what he used, as well as why his entries show up as one or two line summaries, and this is what he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the moment, I don't include entire articles in my RSS feed because
doing so would bulk up the filesize quite a bit.  Most browsers support
Last Modified, Expires, and other HTTP headers used to facilitate
caching (although people can usually change their browser's cache
settings and fetch new copies of pages everytime, few people bother).</p>
<p>Until very recently few RSS aggregators were caching-aware (many still
aren't).  often, they grab fresh copies of feeds even if an HTTP HEAD
request would have told the aggregator that the feed contents had not
changed since the last time it'd fetched the file.</p>
<p>Add to this the fact that many people leave aggregators continuously
running in the background, grabbing the feeds repeatedly at fixed
intervals, and you can understand the effect that big feeds + dumb
aggregators could have on a site owner's monthly transfer allotment.</p>
<p>I've experimented with aggregators from time to time but I haven't seen
any significant advantage to an aggregator over a bookmarked group of
tabs in Moz.  One click and all of my daily visited sites pop up in my
browser - plus I get to see stuff that can't/doesn't get distilled into
an RSS feed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hadn't even thought about this. Thankfully, someone else has: <a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/001132.html">HTTP Conditional GET for RSS Hackers</a>.</p>
<p>Today is my first day with <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a>.  Come by the <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/willowbend/">Willow Bend Store</a> and see me.</p>

<p>After long, long last, I've replaced  an outdated picture with <a href="/?section=photos&amp;img=eandl1">a better one</a>.</p>
<p>Still pursuing the RSS idea, wishing I could implement one over here (though why would anyone want to syndicate this?) and thinking also about why I didn't build a content management system here when I had the drive to do so - when I built the mac.evanrose.com site (which you may or may not remember).  Indeed, this site is and always has been updated by hand, which is why it doesn't get updated very often.  I just can't be bothered to fire up VI and run a deployment script every day, but then I haven't had much to say of late.</p>
<p>Recently found sites to explore: <a href="http://www.xlab.co.uk/macosx/index.php">XLab's OS X blog</a>, <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>, <a href="http://wireless-starter-kit.com/airportblog/">Apple Airport Weblog</a>, and <a href="http://80211b.weblogger.com/">Wi-Fi News</a>.</p>



<h2><a href="?section=archive&amp;date=0301#fifteen" id="fifteen" title="permalink">Wednesday January 15</a></h2>

<p>What a wonderfully productive time I've had on the internet lately.  I've caught up with all of my blogs, right up to the moment by moment present, though I've have to "drop support" for a couple.  <a href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog">little green footballs</a>, a fabulously detailed and maintained warblog has had to go, for instance.  To celebrate the being caught up, I downloaded, installed, and have fallen hopelessly in love with <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire Lite</a>, an RSS and XML agregator.  Though I've been meaning to download and use this for a while, I'm now wondering how I was able to maintain so long without it.  Another offshoot of all of this is that I think I'm going to start updating more often - there's no shortage of goings on.</p>
