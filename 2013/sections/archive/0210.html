<p>On Sunday, while driving by an old "convalescent's home" that's being guttet and remodeled, we discovered a huge cache of old broken office furniture, metal gym locker sets, hospital beds, and a huge silver thing I thought was an iron lung (turned out to be an industrial dryer), all for sale, which I only discovered after half a credenza was poking out of the back of her truck.  I'm also getting two of the locker sets, which are going to make incredible storage pieces in my soon to be new place.  I live for finds like that.</p>

<p>Funny finds today: Andre Torrez's <a href="http://torrez.net/archives/fake_copy_application.php">fake copy application</a> and <a href="http://maddox.xmission.com/">The Best Page in the Universe</a>; absolutely hilarious, especially the critiques of childrens' drawings, parts <a href="http://maddox.xmission.com/irule.html">one</a> and <a href="http://maddox.xmission.com/irule2.html">two</a>.</p>

<p>I visited <a href="http://www.monokromatik.com/">Monokromatik</a> this morning, or tried to, but was redirected to a browser detection script page that I assume is for folks who need to upgrade.  I'm using Mozilla 1.0 on a Mac.  What's up with that?</p>

<p>Just got an email from <a href="http://surfmind.com">andyed</a> asking if I wanted to give <a href="http://uzilla.mozdev.org/">Uzilla</a> another try, but I'd never heard of this thing that seems to be an open source usability testing application.  I did, however, hear about <a href="http://multizilla.mozdev.org/">Multizilla</a>, an ad-on that allows for multiple rows of tabs, recently, and will check that out at some point I'm sure.  I'm still playing the catch up game, and am still pretty far behind.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I saw <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0298130">The Ring</a>, which was good, but made me want to see the original Japanese version, and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0272338">Punch Drunk Love</a>, which was amazing, and I recommend everyone and their dog go see it.  Adam Sandler was spectacular and proved himself a real actor - I've never much cared for his silly shit.  Interestingly, most of the charachters used their real names in the film.</p>

<p>Oh yes, interviewed at <a href="http://match.com">Match</a> today.  Now we wait.</p>

<p><a href="http://match.com">Match</a> called yesterday, I talked to them today, and am going in to talk to them further on Friday, all of which adds an interesting wrinkle to what has become knows as "the plan" (you know, the one that involves the porch swing and all of that).  In other huge news, I found out <a href="http://amontobin.com">Amon Tobin</a>'s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006JM9M/qid=1035348446/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-0768420-7232747?v=glance&amp;n=507846">new record</a> came out last week, so I went and got it and am getting down with it as I write.  Very interesting sound his sound's become - so much less of what it used to be, but so much more at the exact same time.</p>

<p>Saturday, we saw <a href="http://www.angelikafilmcenter.com/Dallas/archive_film.asp?id=208&amp;mode=genre&amp;genreID=5">Disco Dolls in 3D</a>, yesterday we rode the superman ride (a.k.a <a href="http://www.lonestarthrills.com/updates/100402/images/sft02-skycoaster002.jpg">The Skycoaster</a> - there's no way to describe how tall those towers are; I've heard roughly 20 stories) at the fair yesterday, and tomorrow, we leave for two days in a treehouse on Lake Whitney and a night in Austin to see my pal Justin and his lady who will be in town from San Francisco for a wedding.  Good times.</p>

<h2><a href="?section=archive&amp;date=0210#ten" id="ten" title="permalink">Thursday October 10</a></h2>

<p>Things I'm really looking forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a subscription to the Dallas Morning News, which I retrieve in my robe every morning, and copying the crossword puzzle, which I'll finish over cereal, tea, and orange juice every morning</li>
<li>A shared office and library, my half complete with a lounge chair and ottoman, two metal desks, my networked computers and servers, and a view of a tree (shared by the other half, of course)</li>
<li>Not having to watch my step or trying to avoid <a href="http://venus.wis.pk.edu.pl/~dick/dicktionary.html">kibble</a> as I navigate through the house</li> 
<li>A subscription to <a href="http://netflix.com">Netflix</a>, the sole purpose of my to be purchased television</li>
<li>House cleaning, going to the hardware and grocery stores, laundry, cooking, movies, garage sales, and naps on Saturdays</li>
</ul>

<p>and more that will be revealed, I'm sure.</p>

<p>I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380816245/">The First Twenty Million is Always the Hardest</a> last night. After a slow start, the book ended up being pleasantly exciting and intricate.  Also this summer, I've read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380729407/qid=1034267030/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-7976126-5596722?v=glance">Something Wicked This Way Comes</a>, Crash, the spectacular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385302290/qid=1034267261/sr=1-20/ref=sr_1_20/104-7976126-5596722?v=glance">Deep Time</a>, Phillip K. Dick's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0345404475/qid=1034267379/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-7976126-5596722?v=glance">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684801523/qid=1034267410/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-7976126-5596722">The Great Gatsby</a>.  I'm sure there are more, but I don't remember what the could have been.  My book collection is a bit disorganized these days.</p>



<h2><a href="?section=archive&amp;date=0210#seven" id="seven" title="permalink">Monday October 7</a></h2>

<p>A pseudo-decision has been reached regarding what I plan to do with myself in the next couple of months that will dec
ide my fate for the next few years - I think.  After some heart to hearts with the women in my life who's opinions I res
pect the most, I think the plan will include some student loans, a move to a small town just north of here, full time sc
hooling and beyond that?  I don't know, but I'm thinking a little house with space to work on art and building things, w
oodshop, math, and architectural history classes, work in a campus office on web application development, playing the dr
ums, garage sales, and rock and roll shows.  In the meantime, though, we saw <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0179098">
Moonlight Mile</a> and today, Cory and I are finally going to the fair.</p>



<h2><a href="?section=archive&amp;date=0210#five" id="five" title="permalink">Saturday October 5</a></h2>

<p>So I went down to become a member of <a href="http://www.preservationdallas.org/">Preservation Dallas</a> and ended up volunteering for the first Saturday of each month.  I got an email back Thursday from the director thanking me for coming on board and telling me that I should come on down to the tour meeting place so I could join the tour, so that's just what I did.  I ended up riding in his car, avoiding all the busses and getting herded along, and got to see more things and have more time than most on the tour.  The houses were spectacular (and I'm green with envy) and even got to stop at a sale and pick up a <a href="http://www.cooking.com/products/shprodde.asp?SKU=149120">bullet trash can</a> for $2.  All of this reinforces the fact that I am the luckiest person in the entire world and that most of the worrying I've been doing lately, about being "jobless" and thinking things are taking too long, isn't necessary, so long as I keep doing what I need to be doing, which means showing up and doing exactly what I think needs done.</p>



<h2><a href="?section=archive&amp;date=0210#three" id="three" title="permalink">Thursday October 3</a></h2>

<p>So my obsession with "the house" continues; I suppose that I've always felt this way about the thing, but my wanting one has been my primary driving force of late, complete with scams and fantasies - too numerous to go into here.  The point is that I just got very disappointed because <a href="http://www.preservationdallas.org/pd/events/falltour/">the mid-century home tour</a> (complete with a <a href="http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Philip_Johnson.html">Phillip Johnson</a> house) I planned on taking in on Saturday has been sold out.  Today, I'm going to become a member of <a href="http://www.preservationdallas.org/">Preservation Dallas</a> to keep this from happening again.  In other, similar news, we saw <a href="http://www.cowboypictures.com/homemovie/">Home Movie</a>, a very entertaining documentary on nutty houses and the nuts that live in them, followed by <a href="http://www.heavymetalparkinglot.net/">Heavy Metal Parking Lot</a>, which was close enough to the Texas State Fair that I didn't feel so bad about missing it.  The evening ended with my blowing off the DJ Shadow show because the tickets were $26.50.  $26.50 for a guy playing records.  Give me a break.</p>
