<p><a href="http://www.newsisfree.com/">news is free</a>, another news aggregator</p>
<p>i started <a href="http://www.web-graphics.com/mtarchive/000454.php">a thread</a> at <a href="http://web-graphics.com">web-graphics</a> concerning news and how people get it.  a couple of news aggregators have been recommended that i didn't know about: <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/">amphetadesk</a>, <a href="http://unit.bpa.nu">unit.bpa.nu</a>, and <a href="http://www.syndic8.com/">syndic8</a>.  i also learned about <a href="http://optimoz.mozdev.org/gestures/">gestures for mozilla</a>, which i have had absolutely no luck getting to work correctly for what i want it to, and it often works in ways i don't want it to at the wrong time.  it's an amazingly frustrating product.</p>
<p>i've been thinking a lot recently about the <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.gsp?product_id=1795751&amp;cat=41937&amp;type=1&amp;dept=3944&amp;path=0%3A3944%3A3951%3A41937">wal-mart os-less computers</a> i've mentioned previously, thinking one would be perfect for a linux web/file server and for cheap.  A bunch of people have warned me against such things so i started looking into a custom/rebuilt machine.  last night, though, i found <a href="http://linux.com/article.pl?sid=02/04/29/0218241">this article</a> describing successfully loading 3 different operating systems onto one of the wal-mart machines; i'm gonna get me one.</p>

<p>i am sooo sick of surfing the web, but i just keep finding great stuff, such as:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.boardsofcanada.com/">boards of canada</a>'s new website - almost as boring as their music!  good for music, bad for a website.</li>

</ul> 

<p>i used to be a huge fan of flags and when i was in the second or third grade could tell you the name of any country in the world by looking at its flag (could do this with states too - also knew all the states' and countries' capitals) so finding <a href="http://138.251.140.21/~josh/flags/">this site giving letter and number grades to the worlds' flag designs</a> was especially meaningful to me - the commentary is hilarious as well.</p>
