<p>So for the past five weeks, since my gig babysitting my cousin came to an end, I've been down at an old friend and her husband's new restaurant, The Twighlight, in Oak Cliff, which is right outside of Dallas, Texas, bartending and waiting tables.  Unbelievably, even while working for friends and making new friends with my other coworkers, including managers, and providing over-the-top excellent service (which is what I do, by God), I was fired tonight with little to no explanation over an incident that occurred last friday where I failed to get the primary investor's friend a beer.  This has not been good for my self esteem, nor will it be terribly good for paying off the debt that I mentioned <a href="#twentysix">the other day</a>.  I recently applied online to work at the new Apple store that will be openning on Knox Street here in Dallas soon and think that beyond being just a bit more successful with my buying and selling of 50s and 60s modern furniture business, that's what I'd really love to do, which is one of the interesting facts I've learned taking a four month long break from the sitting in front of a monitor making a webpage do stuff business.  Also, I'd like to keep working on my run-on sentences.</p>

<p>We stopped into <a href="http://www.aajalink.com/news/0807/fashion8.shtml">Forty Five Ten</a> this afternoon and I saw a brushed metal dining room table that made me reconsider my whole anti formal dining room thing.  Amazing, and only $9000.  Probably would have made a beautiful desk too.  While I'm at it, I'm dying for two <a href="http://www.dwr.com/productdetail.cfm?id=0115">Eames LCW (Lounge Chair Wood) chairs</a>.</p>

<p>My cousin, Stroud, is getting married weekend after next and I'm about to buy something off of his registry.  I need to get a registry.</p>

<p>Via slashdot - <a href="http://www.byte.com/documents/s=7620/byt1032475416823/0923_bar.html">Flirting with OS X</a> over at byte.com, one man's switch from Linux to OS X.  Speaking of OS X, I've yet to upgrade to Jaguar - I just don't have the funds at the moment.  Getting rid of debt is much more important at the moment.</p>

<p>Hey <a href="http://web-graphics.com">Nate</a>, hey <a href="http://monokromatik.com">Brian</a>, I think I'm going to start updating now - though I'd recommend keeping your hopes high and your expectations low...</p>
