<p>the admin tool i'm building over at <a href="http://mac.evanrose.com">mac.evanrose.com</a> is coming along; its interesting though, that many of the php/mysql routines i've used on other servers don't seem to work on the osx server - perhpaps different versions of the software is the problem?  additionally, i'm having problems with my linux box - it doesn't seem to want to work without a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.  so the saga continues.</p>

<p>there was also some drama with the new firewall for my linux box - but after working on it friday, saturday, and last night, it got fixed.  how?  i don't know - but if you need a bad ass unix admin - i can recommend one.</p>
<p>the redesign came a little sooner than expected because of a little misunderstanding with my <a href="http://winscp.vse.cz/eng/">new scp client</a> (which i highly recommend - just remember - there's a huge difference between "copy" and "move"), however, it was easy to fix and implement - and i think it looks and works great.  there was some drama over my <a href="http://neomail.sourceforge.net/">webmail</a>, but that was easily fixed too.  additonally, i spent some time on the phone with <a href="http://apple.com/">apple</a> and the bank that gave me my apple loan and must say i've gotten better customer service from them than i have from anyone else in i don't know how long.  it all turned out well and my <a href="http://apple.com/imac/">imac</a> will be here this week!</p>

<p>on the osx blog i mentioned <a href="/?section=archive&amp;date=0202#twentysix">the other day</a>, it seems as though they're spending an irritating amount of time talking about various weblog content management systems and the strengths and weaknesses of the same.  i was under the impression that <a href="http://saladwithsteve.com/osx/">forwarding address: osx</a> was for migrators, people who were excited to see what they could do to osx, and what osx could do for them - not for people who's experience of computing and building for the web ended with dreamweaver 4 and <a href="http://www.noahgrey.com/greysoft">greymatter</a>.  note: they have linked to some great stuff, including yesterdays link to the php and mysql installation tutorials (<a href="http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/mysql/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/php/">here</a>, respectively) i linked to <a href="/?section=archive&amp;date=0201#twentynine">in january</a>, but just go on to describe how one could then install phpnuke (another cms?) instead of <a href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/programming/php/tutorials/tutorial4.html">learning a bit of php and sql</a> and building one's own system.</p>
