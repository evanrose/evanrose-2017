<p>Today, we signed a lease on the cutest hardwood floored, groovy old fixtured, one bedroomed, one car garage that's to be turned into a rec/guest/work room-ed, apartment in Denton, Texas.  Also of note, THE SOFA SOLD, which is going to pay my rent for 3 months, and then some.  Unfortunately, I now don't have a sofa, but have plenty of other furniture to put to use.  I guess I'm now in shock at the interesting-ness of life.  These are interesting times.  Perhaps when they get less interesting, I'll get to spend a bit of time on the maintainence this site is desperate for.</p>

<p>Well, I didn't get the job, and it's probably a good thing as I'll now get to concentrate on what's become "Plan A" (as if it wasn't plan A all along - I just get greedy sometimes).  So now, I wait to hear from The University of Texas at Arlington who will decide if I'm worthy of their <a href="http://www.uta.edu/architecture/">architecture program</a>.  In the meantime I've been thinking about RSS newsreaders, building a PHP and SQL backend to make updating this site less of a pain in the ass, Wi-Fi, and waiting for what comes next.</p>
