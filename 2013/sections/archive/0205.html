<p>My plans for leaving town yesterday were foiled by an onerous starter, which I'll be getting replaced today.  It actually worked out well because as of last night, I was still not completely packed, and so that effort, along with the starter replacement, continues.  I expect to be in LA by tonight and Dallas by Wednesday night.</p>

<p>What a day; an end of an era.  Today is my last day with <a href="http://www.onebody.com">OneBody</a>, and I found out today my mother's first cousin Betty died during surgery.  May she rest in peace.  I've got a lot to do <a href="/#upcoming">in the next couple of days and then in the weeks beyond</a>, updates will be sporatic.  Wish me luck!</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/05/arts/music/05REYN.html">NYT article on the 80's being the thing now</a> comes on the heels of a whole mess of articles on the new IDM, electro, and it's associated lifestyle and outlook.  The articles in last week's <a href="http://sfbg.com">SFBG</a> and <a href="http://sfweekly.com/">Weekly</a> were crammed articles on everyone I know in the scene (as well as the scene itself); its very surreal, and it feels good to be a part of something so new and cool, but I still can't help but feel like I can't wait to get away from it all.  By the way, there was an earthquake (my first!), but we barely felt it.</p>
<p>I didn't know how, but I knew that I'd eventually find <a href="http://www.8edge.com/site/main.html">8edge</a> again (great interface zoom and I even dig the flash splash!), and did, finally, at <a href="http://www.gridplane.com/folio/">gridplane</a> (via <a href="http://k10k.net">k10k</a>) and amazingly, they also built <a href="http://miniml.com">miniml</a>, which I linked to <a href="/?section=archive&amp;date=0202#fifteen">recently</a>.  Gotta love the web.</p>

<p>Exceptional DHTML blog interface at <a href="http://phiffer.com/">phiffer.com</a>, very very nice.  Attention to detail extends all the way to the blocks that change color if their associated entry has been read.  Found at <a href="http://kottke.org">kottke.org</a>.</p>
<p>Exellent reads over the weekend: <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/25157.html">MS in Peruvian open-source nightmare</a>, a rebuttal to "Microsoft's standard open-source terror boilerplate", <a href="http://www.mickido.com/Interface/ui_history.html">Microsoft, Apple, and Xerox, The History of the Graphical User Interface</a>, and speaking of reading, I recently finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684813025">City Life</a> by Witold Rybczynski, the architecht and essayist, a study of why European and American cities are so different, and how cities and urban life in America became what it is today.  Every book of his I've read has been great.  Immediately after finishing that one, I started <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312420331/encephalon-20">Crash</a>, by J. G. Ballard.</p>

<p>A great article on <a href="http://kirun.co.uk/web/whymoz/why.htm">Why Mozilla Rules</a> where I learned I could tab through the tabs using Control+Page Up or Page Down and found out about <a href="http://www.xulplanet.com">XUL Planet</a>, where one can download browser skins (dig the IE one) and more.</p>

<p>I've been thinking recently about development - or *my* lack thereof; building a cms for this site (using code from <a href="http://mac.evanrose.com">mac.evanrose.com</a>), continuing development of other sites/apps I'm working on, getting into AppleScript, I just don't have the inclination right now, what with all that's <a href="/#upcoming">coming up</a>.  Development oriented thoughts and links will probably pick up next month, but for now, I'm into quick and humourous things and am even getting back into some <a href="http://k10k.net">high design</a>.

<h2><a href="?section=archive&amp;date=0205#six" id="six" title="permalink">Monday May 6</a></h2>

<p>I love Mondays.  All of my favorite webloggers are in full force every monday, dropping a whole weekend's worth of goodness on me.  These are hilarious: <a href="http://www.silverladder.com/literature/humor/canadians/ihate1.htm">fun facts about Cananda</a> and <a href="http://www.arcataeye.com/police/">the Arcada Eye police reports</a> had me rolling on the floor, laughing my ass off.</p>
<p>My faith has been restored (in reference to <a href="#three">Friday's whine</a>).  Over the weekend, I saw <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0248667">Ali</a>, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0246578">Donnie Darko</a> (visit the <a href="http://www.hi-res.net">Hi-Res!</a> built <a href="http://donniedarko.com">website</a> - wow), and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0203632">The Princess and the Warrior</a>, all great films.  We topped off the weekend by seeing <a href="http://www.buffalodaughter.com/">Buffalo Daughter</a> at <a href="http://www.bimbos365club.com/">Bimbo's</a> last night.</p>

<p>Heh, that was kind of funny - I typed "Top 40" as "Top $0" - which makes more sense, I think...</p>
<p>I won't bemoan the sad state of radio today, I'll just mention that of all the shit that is played on the radio, on average, there is one song a year that makes its way onto the Top 40 airwaves that I end up loving.  That song right now is Schism by <a href="http://www.toolband.com">Tool</a>.  I've been a tool fan since one night in 1994 after dropping my first hit of acid a friend turned me on to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000098O/encephalon-20">Opaite</a> by playing it for 8 hours straight.  I having the same problems with movies these days.  In the past week I've seen <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0235737">The Salton Sea</a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0247586">Nine Queens</a>, both respectable "Independent" films, but both left me somewhat underwhelmed.  I can't wait to be thrilled again by something, be it web, music, or film based.</p>
