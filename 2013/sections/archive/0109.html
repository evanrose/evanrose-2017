<p>my friends the deathray davies have a little <a href="http://www.deathraydavies.com/essej/photoalbum/photoalbum.php?current=1">photo album</a> and <a href="http://www.deathraydavies.com/essej/diary.html">tour journal</a> up.</p>
<p>connected to the internet on my linux box for the first time last night, and even downloaded <a href="http://browsers.netscape.com/browsers/main.tmpl">netscape 6.1</a>!  whoo hoo!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gazingus.org/">gazingus</a> (culled from jeffrey's links <a href="/?section=archive&amp;date=0109#21">mentioned earlier</a>) is a really interesting form oriented tutorial site - though it hasn't been updated in ages.</p>
<p>i had to take deirdre to the emergency room yesterday - she needs <a href="mailto:dburdflew&#64;hotmail.com?subject=get%20better%20soon">some love</a>.</p>

<p>a weekend of frustration and depression - starting and then stopping smoking, again.  as of sunday night, it was ok.</p>
<p>reinstalled linux because it couldn't detect the ethernet card (an intel card with a 1993 copyright date) that was already on my machine, so i wrote down the "recommended ethernet cards" from page 555 of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764548204/encephalon-20">redhat linux 7.1 bible</a> and cruised to the store and picked up a $20 <a href="http://www.smc.com">smc</a> job - the installer picked it right up.</p>
<p>i've been noticing that most of the hardware i've been buying lately only has instructions and support for the various shades of windows - the only thing that's come close to "admitting" that it might be linux compliant is the sec card that advertized the fact that it "offers compatibility with all popular Network Operating Systems."  i wonder why i haven't seen this side of microsoft monopolization in the technical news media?</p>
<p>great site from <a href="http://www.perfect.co.uk/">perfect</a>, the <a href="http://www.tabas.fr/">tabas building</a>  - looks like the guys from <a href="http://www.elixirstudio.com">elixir studio</a> (who we love)</p>

<p>what a week and a half - spent either staying far away from my computer (or having my place too cluttered with the painting to use it) or <a href="http://www.onebody.com">working</a>.  i did hear from simona, from <a href="http://encephalon.org/todays/000702.html">nicola</a>, got my place painted, finally moved into the 1/4 of my home that i previously couldn't use, met <a href="http://www.gatesofheck.com/annie/">annie sprinkle</a> and got a "tit print" and my <a href="/news.txt">list</a> is way overflowing.</p>
<p>from <a href="http://www.eleganthack.com/">elegant hack</a> - the <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/facts/searches.html">search engine watch</a> - very very interesting lately.  fun fact: i heard on npr yesterday morning that the word "sex" was *not* among the top 10 searched words (for the week last week - among all search engines, i believe) for the first time in search engine history.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zeldman.com/coming.html">jeffrey</a> has compiled some web tools for us, and the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http://evanrose.com/">validator</a> has been redesigned.</p>

<p>we're off to <a href="http://www.harbin.org">harbin hot springs</a> this weekend.</p>
<p>i'm amazed at the outpouring of love and information i've encountered just reading my email and surfing the past couple of days.  this horrendous tragedy may well have had a positive effect on our collective psyche by reminding us what's important and why.  thank you to <a href="http://kottke.org/notes/0109.html#010911">jason</a>, <a href="http://camworld.com/journal/2001/09/#12">cam</a> and <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/10034">metafilter</a> for keep us plugged in.</p>

<p>lots of funny stuff found over the weekend: <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~david.st/b3ta/">crazy flash movie</a> gleaned from the astralwerks mailing list, <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3731/god_gives_shout-out.html">god giving shouts out</a> over at the onion, and the <a href="http://www.dutchbint.org/archives/00000453.php3">description and replies</a> (apologies) garnered from a bad keyword sniffing tool.  all of them absolutely hilarious.</p>
<p><a href="http://fray.org/5/sf/">fray day 5</a> was great too - saw and chatted with <a href="http://www.peterme.com">peter</a> saw but missed chatting with <a href="http://www.tomcosgrave.com/">tom</a> (who i met the year before) - also saw <a href="http://camworld.com">cam</a>, <a href="http://www.zeldman.com">jeffrey</a> and <a href="http://kottke.org">jason</a> but decided to continue playing the <a href="http://encephalon.org/stuff/lurking.html">lurker</a> (a good idea considering what happened <a href="http://www.encephalon.org/todays/000925.html">last year</a>).  i did have a nice chat with <a href="http://www.powazek.com">derek</a> who was so nice i couldn't believe it.</p>
<p>redesigned and relaunched <a href="http://inthehead.com/">inthehead.com</a> and laughed at myself when i'd surf back over to look at it, again.</p>

<p>while i try to figure out what's wrong with my router (its always something - <a href="#contact">any advice?</a>) and get my serious <a href="http://www.onebody.com">work on</a> - catching up on my media hasn't been that easy - <a href="http://www.laurieanderson.com">laurie</a> was great last night though.</p>
<p>found at <a href="http://www.evhead.com">evhead.com</a>, the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/mpsa/start.asp">microsoft security scanner</a> - which strikes me as the stupidest thing i've seen in a while.   this web app can get into my computer and detect security flaws?  i don't like this idea   a. microsoft and security in the same sentence is somewhat silly and b. why don't they build one of these to work on their own machines (servers especially - before they ship them)?  if they have, it obviously doesn't work.</p>
<p>my old friend matt lorfing sent me an email with some <a href="http://www.airtoons.com">airtoons</a> attached and reminded me that i hadn't visited in a while and i found out yesterday that <a href="http://www.stereolab.co.uk/tourdates/">stereolab is touring</a>, and i'm going to miss them when they're here.</p>

<p>the dsl-erizing continues, mostly in the research phase: a <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/01/08/05/1326237.shtml">thread on pppoe</a> at slashdot, a <a href="http://www.gigascale.org/gsrc/faq/79.html">how-to</a> for berkeley students, a <a href="http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=20&amp;grid=5">recommended router</a>, and the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=flowpoint+2200">router that i have</a>.  i laughed the other day when i saw that <a href="http://kottke.org">jason</a> seems to be going through some of the <a href="http://kottke.org/notes/0109.html#010902">same stuff</a>.</p>
<p>speaking of the same stuff - i missed this the first time around: <a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Windows-LAN-Server-HOWTO.html">the windows lan server how-to</a> and speaking of links, <a href="http://www.theremediproject.com">the remedi project issue 10</a> is up (and has been for a while).</p>

<p>i'm about to embark on a new journey with another dreaded companion, pacbell.  i'm going to get a new phone switch box installed in my place as the other is almost half a block away (and run through steve's space and run outside and spliced in 2 places), then we're going to get business class dsl service (with the static ip's n'all, then we're going to have a nice fast connection (i was connecting at less than 1kps the other night) like everybody else.</p>
<p>dsl oriented links: <a href="http://www.dslreports.com">dsl reports</a> and <a href="http://www.dns2go.com">dns2go</a> a free recommended dns service for hosting of websites over dsl dynamic ips (more of these <a href="http://www.camworld.com/journal/2001/08/#09">here</a> and <a href="http://a-z-internet.com/dns/services.html">here</a>).  i've also been thinking about ways to get around connecting to pacbell dsl through their "enternet" software so i can have an always on connection to hook both of my computers to and man, there just aren't enough hours in the day.</p>
<p>speaking of what everybody else got, i now have not only a bathroom sink, but i also have an oven and a new bar for hanging clothes on.  the roof garden is also coming along nicely. (again, pics coming soon)</p>
<p>cleaning up all the lists from emails to myself - added some music to <a href="/?section=lists#music">music</a>, and heh, added anchored links in there too.  speaking of music, i just ordered up some discs from dallas tx's favorite record store, <a href="http://www.goodrecords.com">good records</a>.</p>
