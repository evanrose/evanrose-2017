<h3><a href="?section=archive&amp;date=0202#twentyeight" id="twentyeight" title="permalink">thursday february 28</a></h3>

<p>as of right now, i've been alive 9003 days, or 216072 hours, or 12964320 minutes or 777859200 seconds, c/o <a href="http://calendarhome.com/date.shtml">the date calculator</a>.</p>
<p>i just spoke to <a href="http://ditherati.com">ditherati</a>'s owen thomas who called to fact check a blurb on <a href="/?section=work&amp;site=zoza#zoza">zoza</a> for business 2.0.  shit.  <a href="#twentyone">there i go again</a>.</p>
<p>since i'm messing with all this dns (domain name system) stuff for evanrose.com, i went ahead and edited my dns zone file for a domain i own, <a href="http://www.thisiswherewe.com">thisiswherewe.com</a>.  this weekend will be about setting up a dns server at home.  here is linux.com's <a href="http://www.linux.com/howto/DNS-HOWTO.html">dns how to</a> (become a totally small time dns admin).  oh look - i'm #264174 at <a href="http://counter.li.org/">the linux counter</a>.  its a cheese-fest i tell you!</p>
<p>i'm thinking of a redesign over here - as well as thinking about how i'd like this site to work (even though it works the way i want it to now).  we shall see; i have enough on my plate as it is.</p>
<p>good and bad stuff at <a href="http://www.kottke.org/notes/0202.html#020227">kottke.org today</a> - i have not had his problem with a hard drive as i only have a 3 gig drive (a situation i'm looking into correcting soon using this article: <a href="http://www.linuxnewbie.org/nhf/intel/hardware/hd_add.html">adding a hard drive in linux in five steps</a>) - but i am a stephen hawking fan and his speeches (some of which are collected in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553374117/encephalon-20">black holes and baby universes</a> and on <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/lectures/public.html">this page</a>) are notoriously excellent.  also reminds me - i would one day like to own a signed first edition of carl sagan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345331354/encephalon-20">cosmos</a>, one of my all time favorite books.</p>

<p>i just had an idea - actually, i merged some ideas that i've been having off and on and the apple blog mentioned below has been an inspiration.  when i get my imac, i'm going to build a server, database and my own osx/apple blog on it (though that may be a bit too self referential).</p>
<p>why didn't i hear about <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/">apple.slashdot.org</a>? and what's the first thing i find?  oh man <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/features/imacshipping.html">this sucks</a>.</p>
<p>oh cool - an <a href="http://saladwithsteve.com/osx/">osx blog</a> for those of us who are migrating from other environments (via <a href="http://evhead.com">ev</a>).  by the way, i've got a whole shit-load of osx links, tips and how-tos saved up that i'll post in celebrating the day when my imac finally shows up.</p>
<p>update - i've read the osx blog's entire archives - it rocks and has been added to the <a href="/?section=lists#links">list</a>.</p>
<p>oh my god - i just visited <a href="http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/">little green footballs</a>, the "war-blog" that i visit every day, and it hasn't been updated since before the last time i visited, which was yesterday.  this has never happened before. i hope charles (who up untill yesterday was an incredibly prolific weblogger) is ok!</p>

<p>i emailed marcia at <a href="http://www.dutchbint.org">dutchbint.org</a> - a beautiful and standards compliant site with the great <a href="http://www.dutchbint.org/xl.php?2001/09/05.php">bad word catcher</a> i may or may not have linked to before and asked very politely for the source of her php script that grabs words out of a referring query string and then acts upon certain words found there.  she wrote me back saying "hell no!  do it your damn self!" (well, not quite),  so i did (and thank you for the inspiration).</p>

<p>this script will look for my full name in a query string of a referer and print a message based on that.  hack away.</p>

<p><a href="http://www175.pair.com/gat/">the golden arm trio</a> was incredible last night - we're going to see them again on wednesday at <a href="http://cafedunord.com/">cafe du nord</a>- right after we see <a href="http://undertheradar.net">stephen</a> perform at <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/pr/teleopolis.html">teleopolis at the exploratorium</a>.  and ah yes, speaking of books yesterday - i finished zeldman's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735710732/encephalon-20">taking your talent to the web</a> on sunday - very enjoyable though i wouldn't be its primary audience - in the past month or two i've also put away <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140102310/encephalon-20">home</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060932139/encephalon-20">the unbearable lightness of being</a> (finally) and the beginning of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451171357/encephalon-20">the agony and the ecstacy</a>.  its so nice to be reading again.</p>

<p>good surfing: <a href="http://provenanceunknown.com/edit/style.html">web copy style guide</a> - via a bunch of people and <a href="http://afongen.com/essays/xmlcms/">xml, end-to-end network design and content management</a>.  additionally, i got my 5 static i.p. numbers from pacbell last week, reconfigured my router (and will reconfigure it again when i receive my imac and get my linux box running) and surfing has been... uh, exactly the same.  i did have breakfast saturday with the old zozans and <a href="http://www.well.com/~caseyd/">casey</a> hooked me up with a whole slew of good books including <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/getconnect/">getting connected</a> which seems like it might be a great help.</p>
<p>inspired by reading the 3 year old <a href="http://www.time.com/time/reports/millennium/index.html">life's 100 greatest events of the millenium</a> - i went searching for the <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/PaulHry/music/riaa.html">best selling records of all time</a> - it makes pretty good sense - except for the last column entitled "peak position".  does that mean that the backstreet boys' millenium, kenny rogers' greatest hits and boyz II men's II were all at one time another the best selling record of all time?</p>
<p><a href="http://peterme.com/archives/00000141.html">peter loves oakland</a> - and so do i.  saw <a href="http://www.spe.sony.com/cthv/metropolis/">metropolis</a> this weekend - the destruction of the ziggaurat scene to ray charles' "i can't stop loving you" was absolutely breathtakingly animated and emotionally striking as well.  i recommend it. the film's only drawback was its being subtitled that drew the eye from the action to read and keep up with the story - i'm looking forward to the dvd dubbed in english.  i also picked up cornelius' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005S6JT/encephalon-20">point</a></p>

<p>i've seen the following (interesting), way of the gun (could have been better), mifune (cute), rush hour (funny - especially the reference to rosco's chicken and waffles), lord of the rings (pretty good), brotherhood of the wolf (weird, pretty good), black hawk down (pretty stinkin' intense), dark city (again - pretty good) and ocean's 11 (entertaining) recently and probably more that i can't think of.  that's what i do when i'm not doing much else: i see movies.</p>
