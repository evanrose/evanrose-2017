<p>What a pain.  SCP isn't working for my site anymore, so I just downloaded an FTP program to use, my first in years.  Perhaps it has something to do with the new router?  Dunno.  Additionally, I've had a major lack of updates lately, but there's been some stuff going on:</p>
<p>getting moved into the new place, bought a new sofa, and yesterday while christmas shopping for my loved ones, I got one for myself, the <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/Detail.asp?m=1&amp;cat=2&amp;scat=&amp;e=11184642">Rio 350-Watt Dolby Digital/DTS Home Theater System with Progressive-Scan DVD Player</a> which also had a VCR in it.</p>
<p>getting accepted into the <a href="http://www.uta.edu/architecture/">architecture program</a> at UTA and getting a job with Apple working at their <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/willowbend/">Willow Bend Store</a></p>
<p>working on my furniture company's new site, <a href="http://bornagainfurniture.com">bornagainfurniture.com</a></p>
<p>Last but not least, I've gone download crazy after getting a cable hookup, I've used a credit card at a super high-tech laundrymat, and I've been sad to hear about the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/12/12/mroom.stereolab/">death of Stereolab's Mary Hansen</a>.</p>
