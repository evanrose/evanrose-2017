<p>well, the plan changed, and quite a bit too - on our way out of bakersfield yesterday, my clutch went out, and we got stuck at the keene store in <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?city=KEENE&amp;state=CA&amp;country=United%20States">keene, ca</a> - but met the nicest people, got a tow back into town and a ride to the greyhound station, and got back to oakland this morning to sleep all day and see <a href="http://www.royaltenenbaums.com/">the royal tenenbaums</a> this evening.  i'm flying out for dallas tomorrow afternoon, still going to kansas city on thursday, then i'll have to get back to bakersfield to get my car before the 2nd when i have to be back at <a href="http://www.onebody.com">work</a>.</p>

<p>just added a line or two of code to my <a href="/dev/mail/">mailing list program</a> that will mail the list owner when someone subscribes or unsubscribes.  <a href="http://kenflagg.com">ken</a> recommended a randomly generated code to use in the query strings instead of the actual email address for the subscription/unsubscription and i am looking into that.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.enarrative.org/profiles/profile05.html">an interview</a> with my friend <a href="http://www.peterme.com">peter</a> - and i agree with him - <a href="http://www.iplanet.com">iplanet</a> is nice, but i've always been bummed on their <a href="http://www.autodesk.com">autodesk</a> nav...</p>

<p>more about the mailing list(! which, truly, is one of the most fun things i've ever built - and i don't know that i've been prouder of anything i've built either) - the final version is <a href="/dev/mail/">here</a>, and the source is <a href="/dev/mail/mailinglist_source.html">here</a>.  there's still some error handling that i've thought of that might be useful that i can't add at the moment; automatic deletion of email addresses after a bounced message (because i don't know how), checking duplicate records ('cause i'm too busy), and maybe a bit more.</p>

<p>ended up doing a lot more work on the mailing list application <a href="/?section=archive&amp;date=0112#14">i mentioned last week</a>; it now inserts values into the database and sets a no email flag until the subscription is confirmed and there is more advanced error checking.  i'm thinking of offering the system out for people to use but i don't know if its extensible enough...</p>

<p>built a mailing list program in php today - 1 page that weighs less than 3k - feel free to <a href="/misc/mailinglist.txt">check it out</a>, <a href="/dev/mail/">see it in action</a> and use it if you like.  some knowledge of php and mysql is recommended (no more than i have, heh - the webmonkey article <a href="/?section=archive&amp;date=0112#13">i mentioned</a> should help too).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.srl.org">survival research laboratories</a> is this weekend!</p>

<p>built a <a href="/dev/greasydog/">little something</a> that will hopefully become a little something more - and the knowledge of how to build a mailing list came to me in a flash over coffee last night - then d asked me to build one (or was it the other way around?) - so that's what i'm going to do.</p>

<p>i'm thinking very seriously of writing an email to people who proudly display "w3 valid markup images" but whose code doesn't validate and telling them that in order to write valid code, they need to close their tags (even break tags, like this &lt;br /&gt;!), they need to turn their &amp;s into &amp;amp; in hrefs that contain query string name/value pairs and need to alt="" their images.  just a little thing that's not terribly difficult.  they can take one of <a href="http://tantek.com/favelets/">tantek's favelets</a> and validate any page of their site with the click of a button and correct any errors they see.  why am i going to do this?  because there are people who've fought tooth and nail to get us these standards, and its high time we give something back.</p>
<p>the guys over at <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">37signals</a> have written their own commenting system using php/mysql (right on) - apparently greymatter crapped out on them too like <a href="/?section=archive&amp;date=0112#4">i've mentioned before</a>.  <a href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/programming/php/tutorials/tutorial4.html">here is the article at webmonkey</a> that i point to when i hear someone wants to begin work with php/mysql - its an easy read and tells you everything you'd (almost) ever want to know.</p>

<p>browser stupidness: i've bitched about browser anchor tag linking <a href="/?section=archive&amp;date=0107#28">before</a> - and now, with this new <a href="#options">style swither</a> and .js include file - my <a href="/?section=work#sites">portfolio sites functionality</a> no longer works. actually, only anchors on the same page (without reloading) work.  i think the style switcher has to go.</p>
<p>more groovy edits: i removed the success page display from the .cgi mailer and replaced it with a redirect that sets a mail variable to true and sends the name to the page where the mail was sent, thus displaying the "thank you" with the name and aleviating my need to redesign that success page when the layout of this site changes (like it did yesterday!  <a href="#contact">try it</a>).  also followed suit with the <a href="#options">search</a> success page - yay.</p>
