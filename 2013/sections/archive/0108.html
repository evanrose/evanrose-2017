<h2><a href="?section=archive&amp;date=0108#30" title="thursday august 30 - permalink">thursday august 30</a><a id="30"></a></h2>

<p>just begun visiting the <a href="http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/weblog.php">little green weblog</a> again and found some groovy useful stuff - a <a href="http://www.searchengineworld.com/robots/robots_tutorial.htm">tutorial on creating robots.txt files</a> and a <a href="http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/weblog.php?y=1&amp;x=archives/00001015.htm">list of mysql resources</a> which i'll get back to as soon as i get it running on my linux box at home which is still a ways away...</p>
<p>just in the past few days i've heard from a whole bunch of friends in dallas who i'd not heard from in a while - jason, micah, jayna - then <a href="http://www.uripides.com">matt</a> and jaime (from the spa down the street from the 'haus) who both live out here now came to my dj gig last night - and speaking of friends, dinner with ed and diana on sunday night was wonderful.</p>
<p>added my <a href="/misc/toprint.html">to print list</a> - <a href="/index.php?section=archive&amp;date=0108#21">like i said</a>, i have a lot of reading to catch up on.  speaking of reading, i'm reading <a href="http://www.rense.com/general7/whyy.htm">why mcdonald's fries taste so good</a> and it's making me want to never eat again.</p>

<p>i woke up this morning thinking about my old place, the place i moved out of in order to move to california - so little and cute - "bookish" as michael put it, that was a good place - a place where i built my first websites and had lots of good times.  i remembered calls from cory to go to <a href="http://dfw.citysearch.com/E/V/DALTX/0005/24/98/cs1.html">john's</a> on sundays and the night my power went out and larkin, <a href="http://lozenge.net">john</a>, daria and michael were over and there was a furious rainstorm and my <a href="http://encephalon.org/todays/000229.html">long mornings</a>... good memories.</p>
<p>added: updated my <a href="/resume">resume</a>, added some stuff (<a href="/misc/favorites.html">bookmarks</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/wishlist/3KJX035CBI91E/">amazon wishlist</a>) to the <a href="/index.php?section=lists">lists</a>, and added a groovy <a href="http://validator.w3.org">validator</a> link at the <a href="#validator">very bottom of each page</a>.</p>
<p>if you'd like such a validator to work across a partially dynamically driven website (if only for your own curiosity), cut and past this code into your template:</p>
<p>&lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"&gt;<br />
&lt;!--<br />
document.write('&lt;a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=' +location.href+ '"&gt;validate&lt;/a&gt;');<br />
// --&gt;<br />
&lt;/script&gt;</p>
<p>nuthin' to it.</p>

<p>when i first got <a href="http://www.onebody.com/">here</a>, people were asking me about things that appeared on my site(s - i guess the links were making the rounds), most notably, my <a href="http://encephalon.org/stuff/newyears.html">new years resolutions</a> over at <a href="http://encephalon.org/">encephalon.org</a>).  looking back - i know i ain't done that great, but i haven't checked that out in a long time.</p>
<ul><li>switch to a lighter smoke - actually did that, now officially have not had a smoke since the evening of the 22nd (this time)</li>
<li>smoke when i get to work - never did end up doing that</li>
<li>12 month collage - an idea for an art project which would have been very cool - it would have been easy to thematicize this year - its been all about d and working on my place</li>
<li>make As - did that and will continue to do so</li>
<li>swear less - uh, no comment</li>
<li>switch from coffee to tea - finally, this month i no longer drink coffee on any sort of basis.  i've had 3 cups in the past month.  lets hear it for yerba matt&eacute;</li>
<li>try to completely cut out candy/cookies - uh, no.  cut way way down though.</li>
<li>cook more - heh, i did end up cooking quite a bit, if pasta counts.  d's hookin' it up though!</li>
<li>see one movie a week - didn't do that, but still trying</li>
<li>get out more - did get out for quite a while - not too terribly interested in the scene - i could stand to get my culutre on a bit more.  soon.</li>
<li>pay more attention to dress - have done this - and dressing better through simplification (oddly, most people would say i'm quite stylish)</li>
<li>get out more - this was in here twice - perhaps i copied and pasted in order to write another but never did...</li></ul>
<p>oh, but looking back (i seem to have deleted some as i "overcame them" - i did completely give up peanut butter and smoking in my car and bedroom (and eventually in my house - which has helped my not smoking at all)</p>
<p>heh - <a href="http://bbspot.com/News/2000/4/MS_Buys_Evil.html">microsoft purchases evil from satan</a> and <a href="http://128.241.244.96/portal/uploads/27000/27549_winrg.swf">this</a> is the funniest fucking thing i've ever seen.</p>

<p>lyndon at <a href="http://pulsate.org">pulsate</a> has put up <a href="http://pulsate.org/contour/10/01.htm">issue 10 of contour</a> - fantabulous work as usual and lyndon?  i'm thinking a desktop section is in order.  in addition - i heard about this, <a href="http://www.flong.com/telesymphony/">the telesymphony</a> on npr the other day (link care of <a href="http://ampersand.pitas.com">&amp;pitas</a>).</p>
<p>i've been using <a href="http://www.kazaa.com">kazaa</a> to feed my mp3 addiction - but just heard about <a href="http://www.winmx.com">win mx</a>, which is supposed to be better.  heh, just got a cd burner too.</p>
<p>i made <a href="/misc/quiz/quiz.html">this javascript based quiz</a> yesterday - and oh man just remembered: <a href="http://laney.peralta.cc.ca.us/">school</a> starts tonight!</p>
<p>just got tickets to see <a href="http://www.laurieanderson.com">laurie anderson</a> at bimbo's september 6.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.leapfrog.com/">leapfrog launched</a> last thursday and (or but?) i am now at <a href="http://www.onebody.com/">onebody</a>.</p>
<p>i put up walls this weekend - my first two ever (photos of the walls along with chronological documentation of the saga of building out our warehouse space coming soon) and that felt way way better than changing my tire last week - it takes more and more to make me feel like a real man these days.</p>
<p>reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684853787/encephalon-20">bobos in paradise</a> (which i mentioned <a href="/index.php?section=archive&amp;date=0108#15">last week</a>) and it is absolutely excellent.  i went through my books yesterday when i put them on their bench against one of the two walls and realized that i have a lot of reading to catch up on.</p>

	
<h2><a href="?section=archive&amp;date=0108#15">wednesday august 15</a><a id="15"></a></h2>

<p>i happened to glance at my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/wishlist/3KJX035CBI91E">amazon wishlist</a> the day before yesterday for the first time in months (when i added <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735710732/encephalon-20">zeldman's bobok</a>) and noticed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684853787/encephalon-20">bobos in paradise</a> way down at the bottom (like i said, i just glanced) and then that same night, d came home with it.  wierd.</p>
<p>i forgot to mention that i added the old stuff from encephalon.org to <a href="/index.php?section=lists">lists</a> - and speaking of other sites - i got got my index.phps mixed up and blew away most of inthehead.com... not that it matters so much (redirects and all), but thank god for back ups in general.</p>
<p>its amazing that this beautiful powerful little laptop i'm working with becomes a useless piece of junk when the internet connection goes down - and makes writing a sentence like this feel really stupid.</p>
<p>today is my last day with <a href="http://www.smallpondstudios.com">small pond</a> on the <a href="http://www.leapfrog.com">leapfrog</a> project.  coming soon to <a href="http://www.onebody.com">one body</a>.</p>

<p>finally, after many many install failures, i got linux installed (please lower the barrier of entry - we can't have <a href="http://latimes.com/technology/la-000064605aug09.story">this</a>...).  it seems as though the partitioning was the issue - for future reference - let the installer partition the disk!  it knows best!  so now i'm finding my way around <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">gnome</a> and diggin' it.</p>
<p>i spun records at diesel yesterday - for almost 5.5 hours - didn't get the splitting headache that usually comes from listening to different beats in each ear for that length of time but did come real close to running out of records... <a href="http://www.diesel.com/denim/fw01/">free jeans are worth it</a>.</p>
<p>damn, <a href="http://camworld.com">cam's been busy</a> - which is great for the rest of us!  in other linking news - k10k and xl5 have put together a little design zine called <a href="http://www.xl5design.com/dodge/">dodge</a>.</p>

<p>redesigning websites is fun - 'specially when it takes less than an hour - did a bunch of cleaning up as well - added a css nowrap fix (that i found <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/css/winie/whitespacedemo.html">here</a>), cut some code to make includes, redesigned the cgi emailer 'thanks' page... and i'm getting paid to do this shit too.  dsl getting installed is fun too.  what's not fun is <a href="/index.php?section=archive&amp;date=0108#08">trying to install linux</a> three different times three different ways and having it fail each time.</p>
<p>various and assundry get-togethers: lunch today with angela v., ben h. (of zoza.com fame)'s housewarming party on saturday and <a href="http://peterme.com">peter</a> on sunday.</p>
<p>i'm on the <a href="http://www.altsense.net">alt.sense</a> happy.birthday mailing list and i save the weekly email from them that contains dates, the people whose birthdays are on those dates and links to their website and/or email.  most of the people who 'sign up' are designers and the purpose, of course, is to drive traffic to their online counterparts.  its unbelievable how many of these sites (like i said, i save the weekly email and go through them about once every two months) don't <a href="http://as;dlkfj;laksjdfasd;lkfj">justify</a> or are splash pages warning of an impending launch.  the rest of the lot are awful (awful!) flash portfolios of art students.  thankfully, there are some <a href="http://www.opuscreative.com/">good ones</a> now and then.</p>
<p>i'm playing records at diesel (<a href="http://www.diesel.com/">view map</a>) sunday from 12pm - 6pm.</p>

<p>its been all about dsl installation on my laptop and setting up linux on my desktop with the help of the <a href="http://catalog.hungryminds.com/product.asp?isbn=0764548204">red hat linux 7.1 bible</a> - so far a great book (even though i'm only in the installation chapter).  i also picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761524460/encephalon-20">emacs and xemacs</a> and the new <a href="http://www.wallpaper.com">wallpaper</a> design directory.</p>
<p>now i'm thinking about how to open up links in new windows instead of using the &lt;a href="#"&gt; method - typing that over and over sucks.</p>
<p>i'm also thinking about bringing over the "stuff" and other stuff from <a href="http://encephalon.org/">encephalon</a></p>
