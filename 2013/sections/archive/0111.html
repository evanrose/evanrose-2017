<p>more development over here - edited the <a href="/?section=map">site map</a> to display a little chunk of info should a 404 or other error occur (<a href="/asdf/asdf.html">try it</a>), then created some error checking for the query string - instead of the standard php warning that displays if something is in the string that shouldn't be, the section is set equal to map and error to true, displaying the said <a href="/?section=map&amp;error=true">error page</a>.</p>
<p>after reading quite a bit on the nature of comics at <a href="http://xplane.com/xblog/comics/">xplane</a> and <a href="http://peterme.com">peterme</a> among other places, i never thought about their being comics online ('cept <a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/">dieselsweeties</a> - but oh my goodness - every syndicated comic that i grew up with (i even had the books of a lot of them) are available (drum roll please...) on the internet!  so i could conceivably get my <a href="http://www.garfield.com">garfield</a> or <a href="http://fbofw.com/">for better or for worse</a> on anytime i wanted... if i had the time...</p>

<p>in the interest of trying to do as much as i possibly can with this thing - i've incorporated several new things that i <a href="/?section=archive&amp;date=0111#15">did not build myself</a>: the <a href="#switcher">style switcher</a> (learn all about it <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/alternate/">here</a>) and did away with the php based one i had going before - primarily because in testing the <a href="#search">search engine</a> (powered by <a href="http://atomz.com">atomz</a>, thankyouverymuch), pages with and without style would get indexed (in fact, there's still some odd indexing going on - but what the hell.  its all in the name of good clean fun).  what's really cool is the style persistence to my cgi mailer and to the search results page.</p>
<p>(speaking of) i also had quite a bit of trouble with the .cgi script that sends mail from the <a href="#contact">contact form</a> - but fixed it with an old version of the file - i have no idea what the problem might have been.</p>

<p>what a great long weekend - dinner at the fabulous <a href="http://www.milleniumrestaurant.com/">millenium</a>, saw the excellent <a href="http://www.themanwhowasntthere.com/">the man who wasn't there</a> and the also excellent <a href="http://www.mulhollanddrive.com/ ">mulholland drive</a> (though it got kinda requiem for a dream-ish there at the end...) and built a room in the place and more specifically designed a pulleyed wall moving system to open up the space when in use and when not in use, the wall can be moved to create a hallway.  i was pretty stinkin' pleased.</p>
<p>next weekend?  the franklin woodburning stove.</p>
<p>new and groovy: from the <a href="http://www.pulsate.org">pulsate</a> newsletter - <a href="http://www.prangstgrup.com/">prangstgrup.com</a>, the <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~elout/">pixel lab</a> redesigned, and the pretty <a href="http://www.idontsmoke.co.uk/">i don't smoke</a> - 'specially the groovy links page (wink wink) - and speakin' of winkin' - <a href="http://www.succaland.com">succaland.com</a> helped me find the <a href="http://maybeiam.com/">coy girl</a>.</p>

<p>finished up the <a href="/?section=work#sites">portfolio thing</a> - got the screenshots, got the echo-ing to validate and lay out correctly, even got the "view all" to work (and figured out the "or" operator too) - yay.  some sort of search engine is next... though now that <a href="http://kottke.org">kottke</a> has launched a new discussion system (a la everybody), i'm wondering when every site on the internet will have an atomz search and other things - and halfway through writing that last sentence, i remembered that he said *he wrote it* and decided to shut up.  by the way, changed the color, then changed it again.</p>
<p>other new things learned - an entirely new way to access my .cgi scripts (at least at <a href="http://he.net">hurricane electric</a> - ooh, and now grabbing the "mailed from" page and i.p. number of the user sending the mail) which i've never known about, and ie 5 (or was it 5.5?) for the mac disregards float:right;.</p>

<p>oh man - i've heard the hype an have seen the ads, but checking the specs out on <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">the apple ipod</a> makes me think about branchin out even more - 'specially since they're going for 500$ around here.</p>
<p>open a telnet session to towel.blinkenlights.nl - you shall be amazed!  (via <a href="http://onepointzero.com">1.0</a>) kind of reminded me of <a href="http://download.theforce.net/theater/stardudes.html">star dudes</a>, another fun one - <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/andrew.harrison4/">this</a> is pretty funny too.</p>
<p>i've re-worked the <a href="/?section=archive">archive nav</a> (no more running out of room for this guy!) and have begun keeping the current month's entries on the main page with the previous and next thang going... getting my <a href="http://kottke.org">kottke</a> on, so to speak.  i've also begun work on a <a href="/?section=work#sites">dynamic portfolio section</a> and by the way - i mentioned that i don't like implementing things i didn't build - and i did not build the layout of this site (created with <a href="/src/evanrose.css">css</a>), owen briggs' <a href="http://www.thenoodleincident.com/tutorials/box_lesson/boxes.html">box lesson</a> helped, as did an article at <a href="http://alistapart.com">ala</a>.  i also did not write the perl that send mail from my <a href="#contact">contact form</a>, but i've hacked away at both enough to call them my own (i'll keep trying to give props where they're due).</p>

<p>i've owned <a href="http://encephalon.org">encephalon.org</a> for 2 years - and what an amazing difference between my life two years ago and my life now - but such a short length of time in the long run.</p>
<p>this weekend we saw the "each moment more twisted than the last" <a href="http://www.midnighteye.com/reviews/visitorq.shtml">visitor q</a> at the yerba buena (and going back to see <a href="http://satanwasalady.com/">satan was a lady</a> next weekend), saw coworker <a href="http://www.kenflagg.com/">ken</a> play, then topped the night off with the "disgusting but you just can't tear your gaze away" <a href="http://www.wedding-planner-movie.com/">wedding planner</a>.</p>
<p>like i said i was going to on friday, i made a <a href="#validator">style sheet switcher</a> (<a href="/?section=<?php echo $section;?>&amp;style=none">try it out</a>) though didn't use the one in the <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/switcher.html">ala tutorial</a> - too much javascript and i don't like implimenting things i didn't build.  oh yes, and gave the nav some love last week too - i thought i'd come up with a new design before it <a href="/?section=archive">filled up</a>.</p>
