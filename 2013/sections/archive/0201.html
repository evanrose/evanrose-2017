<p>i started out the new year at d's place, the party was amazing, then the next day drove with jen back to california with all her stuff and my new sofa and chairs where we would share my apartment for the month of january.  i also had another interesting experience that month.</p>
<p>in february, i visited dallas for presidents' day weekend to hang out with cory and ended up spending the second half of the weekend at the loft with d.</p>
<p>in march i began looking into getting a place in the east bay. my friend geoff almost got his head blown off and he moved away.  we also started spinning records at fuse.</p>
<p>i stayed with d for nine beautiful days in april and fell in love.</p>
<p>in may, ange stayed at my place for the month and i found my warehouse space in oakland.  <a href="/?section=work&amp;site=zoza#zoza">zoza</a> closed and i started working again with <a href="http://www.smallpondstudios.com">small pond</a>.</p>
<p>d arrived here on june the 17th, we started working on the new place and packed.  we also began trying to quit smoking.</p>
<p>we moved into the new place on the 1st of july, then got a shower three weeks later.  my mom visited and i got sick as hell.  i also launched this site right here.</p>
<p>in august, i began working for <a href="http://www.onebody.com">onebody</a> and installed linux on one of my computers at home.</p>
<p>september we'll all remember forever.</p>
<p>in october i went to china, south korea and japan, and got to spend a little time with friends in dallas.</p>
<p>we saw a lot of movies and ate at millenium in november.</p>
<p>in december, the car broke down in bakersfield, we greyhounded back, i flew to dallas, and spent time with daria, larkin and <a href="http://www.lozenge.net">john</a> in kansas city.</p>
<p>a very "interesting" year - to say the least - glad the new one is here.</p>
